What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages? Newborns: with artificial feeding, malnutrition and exhaustion, with a deficiency of digestive enzymes, with taking antibiotics and other medications, with hormonal treatment, with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal colic, with the development of pathogenic flora in the intestines, infectious processes in the digestive organs, inflammation of the colon mucosa, enterocolitis, intestinal dysfunction, allergic reactions associated with skin or intestinal lesions, diseases of the oral cavity, constipation, helicobacteriosis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and genitourinary systems.Biodonatum is taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime before meals or during meals with a small amount of liquid up to 5 ml (except milk) 15-30 drops per dose or 0.5 ml.After improvement of the condition, the daily dose can be changed; a 12-week course of treatment is recommended.To restore microflora in children of the first year of life.It is recommended to start taking Biodonatum with a minimum dose of 15-30 drops 3 times a day, for 10-14 days. When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

In 2017, the human microbiome was recognized as a separate organ. Humans have 21,000 genes, and the bacteria that make up our body have 4.4 million genes. Already today, scientists have been able to classify about 5,000 microorganisms in our microbiome, which in 90% of cases cannot be cultivated in laboratory conditions. Therefore, we are saying that a person, together with genetically compatible microorganisms living in his intestines, represents a Superorganism with the organized work of enzymes encoded by the human genome and the genomes of all symbiotic microorganisms. About 2.5-3 kg of bacteria live in our intestines; their weight is approximately equal to the weight of the human brain. It has been scientifically proven that the gut and brain communicate through the vagus nerve. The intestine is the first organ of the body’s immune system and contains more than 80% of all immunoglobulins, 10 (6) lymphocytes and 1 g of lymphoid tissue.Microbiotic Biodonatum is a food supplement that contains 16 strains of fermented metabolites of lactobacilli. Active metabolites of lactobacilli are harmonious “food” for your unique microbiome. Each sachet contains active metabolites of lactobacilli. Biodonatum helps maintain the balance and diversity of the intestinal microbiome.Biodonatum promotes healthy digestion and relieves bloating.Enhances healthy stool hydration and facilitates stool evacuation.Supports intestinal barrier function and integrity.Supports healthy gut immunity.Supports skin health.Microbiotic Biodonatum has a subtle lemon taste. Dissolve 1 sachet in a glass of water at room temperature (30-50 ml), 1-2 times a day, leave for 1 minute to activate the metabolites, then stir and drinkOur microbiotic is presented in liquid form, because the active metabolites of probiotic strains are able to pass through the aggressive environment of the gastrointestinal tract; while moving through the gastrointestinal tract, they are activated and begin to actively work in the intestinal parietal flora.It is advisable to take Biodonatum on an empty stomach; if you take Biodonatum 2 times a day, it is advisable to take it before breakfast and dinner.Precautions for use. Excessive consumption of Biodonatum may have a laxative effect.Biodonatum is available in the form of sachets, which do not require special storage and are convenient to take with you wherever you go.Biodonatum production is 100% ecological and biotechnological, so it does not contain dyes, sweeteners and flavor enhancers, sugar and gluten.Our bio-sachets are safe for the planet, and Biodonatum packaging is made from cardboard during production, which consumes fuel, electricity and carbon dioxide emissions by 60% lower than in the production of other packaging materials. The Institute for Energy and Environment Research (IFEU) has found that cardboard packaging has no greenhouse effect, no mineral depletion and is completely biodegradable within 3 months. Cardboard also has a high energy potential, it may seem surprising to you, but the calorific value of 2 tons of cardboard corresponds to a ton of crude oil and therefore in many countries cardboard packaging is used as a cheap source of thermal energy.The composition of BIODONATUM is the result of a unique production process. The production cycle of LAB fermented metabolites lasts 1 year and is completely organic.BIODONATUUM – metabolites of 16 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), fermented with a mixed culture of three species of Lactobacillus (10 strains of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, 4 strains of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and 2 strains of Levilactobacillus brevis), citric acid, lactic acid, water.1 sachet of BIODONATUM, i.e. 5 mg, contains 0.6 g of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), metabolites fermented by a mixed culture of three Lactobacillus species (10 strains of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, 4 strains of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and 2 strains of Lactobacillus brevis). . Assuming that all LAB strains increased uniformly, the metabolite distribution is estimated to be 0.375 g, 0.15 g and 0.075 g metabolites for Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Levilactobacillus brevis respectively, citric acid 0.05 g, lactic acid 0.37 g, water 4.33 g.Nutrient content table per 1 sachet (5 ml) * Energy 0,2 kcal Proteins 0 g Fat 0 g Carbohydrates 0,1 g Sugar 0 g Mass equivalent of table salt 0,0 g Phosphorus 0,0 mg Potassium 0,1 mgDoes not contain animal proteins, gluten, yeast or lactose.

Biodonatum is an organic dietary supplement from Japan, belongs to the class of postbiotic-microbiotic. The evolution of Probiotics development has led to the creation of Microbiotic, which are natural bioactive substances produced by probiotic microorganisms.Our postbiotic-microbiotiis produced through a proprietary multi-step process that takes 2 years to complete. This process produces immune-supporting compounds and metabolites such as proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, polysaccharides, fiber and other nutrients that nourish the body’s immune system, strengthening resistance and supporting well-being.Biodonatum creates an ideal environment for the growth of your native beneficial intestinal bacteria, while blocking pathogenic microflora, helping to restore a healthy balance of intestinal microflora and proper functioning of the GI tract. The cellular material of bacteria included in Biodonatum helps to restore and strengthen the immune system.Biodonatum begins to work directly on the mucous membrane. During passage through the gastrointestinal tract, 10 bi lion active microbiotic metabolites are activated and reach the pre-wal flora of the large intestine in 100% volume. Why do the products have a high cost? The cost of the product is determined by several factors:100% bio production cycle in the protected area of Mount Fuji80% of production is manual labor from the harvest stage to the stage of bacterial fermentationa unique production cycle that has been developed over 110 years and no one in the world can repeat ita unique composition in liquid sachet forma formula with 100% bioavailabilityit is due to such a long fermentation process that we obtain a unique composition containing bacterial cellular material and their DNA, more than 500 peptides, essential amino acids, fatty acids and all the necessary vitamins and microelements. Does Biodonatum help after taking antibiotics? Taking Postbiotic Biodonatum is recommended together with and after taking antibiotics. Clinical studies show that Postbiotic supports good bacteria and the intestinal microbiome during antibiotic therapy, reducing its damage and the negative impact of antibiotics on the overall health of the body.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages? Newborns: with artificial feeding, malnutrition and exhaustion, with a deficiency of digestive enzymes, with taking antibiotics and other medications, with hormonal treatment, with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal colic, with the development of pathogenic flora in the intestines, infectious processes in the digestive organs, inflammation of the colon mucosa, enterocolitis, intestinal dysfunction, allergic reactions associated with skin or intestinal lesions, diseases of the oral cavity, constipation, helicobacteriosis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and genitourinary systems.Biodonatum is taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime before meals or during meals with a small amount of liquid up to 5 ml (except milk) 15-30 drops per dose or 0.5 ml.After improvement of the condition, the daily dose can be changed; a 12-week course of treatment is recommended.To restore microflora in children of the first year of life.It is recommended to start taking Biodonatum with a minimum dose of 15-30 drops 3 times a day, for 10-14 days. When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

In 2017, the human microbiome was recognized as a separate organ. Humans have 21,000 genes, and the bacteria that make up our body have 4.4 million genes. Already today, scientists have been able to classify about 5,000 microorganisms in our microbiome, which in 90% of cases cannot be cultivated in laboratory conditions. Therefore, we are saying that a person, together with genetically compatible microorganisms living in his intestines, represents a Superorganism with the organized work of enzymes encoded by the human genome and the genomes of all symbiotic microorganisms. About 2.5-3 kg of bacteria live in our intestines; their weight is approximately equal to the weight of the human brain. It has been scientifically proven that the gut and brain communicate through the vagus nerve. The intestine is the first organ of the body’s immune system and contains more than 80% of all immunoglobulins, 10 (6) lymphocytes and 1 g of lymphoid tissue.Microbiotic Biodonatum is a food supplement that contains 16 strains of fermented metabolites of lactobacilli.

Can Biodonatum prevent dysbiosis? Biodonatum is designed to prevent dysbiosis.It nourishes your microbiome and does not allow pathogenic flora to develop, suppressing its growth.Protects your body from the effects of toxins from the environment.Supports the bacteria-cell axis, which means it maintains hormonal balance, which makes you happier and more stress-resistant.If you are flying on vacation or on a business trip, we recommend that you take Biodonatum with you and drink water only with Biodonatum, since a change in climate and time zones entails a change in the bacteria that surround you, especially water.Biodonatum is a reliable protection against dysbacteriosis of any origin. Can children take Biodonatum? Studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota of a child develops well beyond the first three years of life, acquiring its final composition only after puberty.Thanks to the symbiotic action between beneficial colonizing bacteria, the intestinal epithelium and the associated lymphoid system, the infant’s intestine matures after birth, improving its barrier functions and immunological regulation in the first stages of life.Postbiotic Biodonatum is indicated for use by children from 0 years of age, as it has a local anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial effect on pathogenic strains.Postbiotic Biodonatum is completely safe and effective for children. Its use as a supplement in seriously ill patients, such as premature babies, does not pose a risk in terms of bacterial translocation and induction of bacterial resistance. Is Biodonatum recommended for oral microflora disorders? The oral cavity plays a crucial role in digestion and immune defense.This means that maintaining oral health is essential.Postbiotic Biodonatum has an increased antibacterial potential with stable viability, as the liquid form works perfectly on the oral mucosa, protecting the body from the penetration of pathogens and viruses.Biodonatum restores the oral microbiome in the form of a biofilm, which regulates oral homeostasis, oral immunity, digestion, detoxification, eliminates inflammatory processes and participates in disease prevention.You need to rinse your mouth 3 times a day after eating Bidonatum and then swallow.Biodonatum is oral health.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages? Newborns: with artificial feeding, malnutrition and exhaustion, with a deficiency of digestive enzymes, with taking antibiotics and other medications, with hormonal treatment, with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal colic, with the development of pathogenic flora in the intestines, infectious processes in the digestive organs, inflammation of the colon mucosa, enterocolitis, intestinal dysfunction, allergic reactions associated with skin or intestinal lesions, diseases of the oral cavity, constipation, helicobacteriosis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and genitourinary systems.Biodonatum is taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime before meals or during meals with a small amount of liquid up to 5 ml (except milk) 15-30 drops per dose or 0.5 ml.After improvement of the condition, the daily dose can be changed; a 12-week course of treatment is recommended.To restore microflora in children of the first year of life.It is recommended to start taking Biodonatum with a minimum dose of 15-30 drops 3 times a day, for 10-14 days. When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages? Newborns: with artificial feeding, malnutrition and exhaustion, with a deficiency of digestive enzymes, with taking antibiotics and other medications, with hormonal treatment, with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal colic, with the development of pathogenic flora in the intestines, infectious processes in the digestive organs, inflammation of the colon mucosa, enterocolitis, intestinal dysfunction, allergic reactions associated with skin or intestinal lesions, diseases of the oral cavity, constipation, helicobacteriosis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and genitourinary systems.Biodonatum is taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime before meals or during meals with a small amount of liquid up to 5 ml (except milk) 15-30 drops per dose or 0.5 ml.After improvement of the condition, the daily dose can be changed; a 12-week course of treatment is recommended.To restore microflora in children of the first year of life.It is recommended to start taking Biodonatum with a minimum dose of 15-30 drops 3 times a day, for 10-14 days. When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages? Newborns: with artificial feeding, malnutrition and exhaustion, with a deficiency of digestive enzymes, with taking antibiotics and other medications, with hormonal treatment, with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal colic, with the development of pathogenic flora in the intestines, infectious processes in the digestive organs, inflammation of the colon mucosa, enterocolitis, intestinal dysfunction, allergic reactions associated with skin or intestinal lesions, diseases of the oral cavity, constipation, helicobacteriosis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and genitourinary systems.Biodonatum is taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime before meals or during meals with a small amount of liquid up to 5 ml (except milk) 15-30 drops per dose or 0.5 ml.After improvement of the condition, the daily dose can be changed; a 12-week course of treatment is recommended.To restore microflora in children of the first year of life.It is recommended to start taking Biodonatum with a minimum dose of 15-30 drops 3 times a day, for 10-14 days. When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days.

In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

What % of probiotics are absorbed in the intestines? Less than 0.0001% of the probiotic is absorbed in the intestines.In other words, Probiotics have very low bioavailability.Some of the ingested bacteria contained in the probiotic die during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. On average, only one microbial cell in 1,000,000 reaches the colon, the main habitat of normal flora.Probiotics are made from “universal” production cultures of microbes. They may be incompatible with individual bacterial cultures for each individual.Probiotic cells can be killed by most antibiotics, and some of them are involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.There is evidence that some probiotic bacteria can cause various diseases.What is the bioavailability of Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic?Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic has 100% bioavailability, active metabolites reach the intestines unchanged.They do not conflict with a person’s microbiota.They are in active form and begin to act immediately when they enter the gastrointestinal tract. What are the main properties of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic? Immunomodulatory property.Anti-inflammatory property.Antiallergic: activation of macrophages and reduction of the effect of intestinal leakage, which in turn leads to skin quality and therapeutic effect against eczema and neurodermatitis.Antioxidant effect: effect on the intestinal walls, i.e. colonocytes and enterocytes, stabilization of telomere length and prevention of cancer.Membrane stabilizing effect: normalization of the flora by reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work for cancer patients? Modern world protocols now include additional “weapons” like postbiotics, because it is the correction of the microbiome that allows restoring the axis between good bacteria and cells, “restores” immune cells from macrophages to T-killers and provides effective antitumor treatment, i.e. the body’s response to therapy. With age, bacterial diversity declines sharply and clinical studies in postmenopausal women have shown a direct relationship between breast cancer and the predominance of pathogenic flora in the gut.Among the estrogen-independent pathways affecting breast cancer, bacterial metabolites derived from fiber fermentation, bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism\/elimination directly or indirectly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.A well-known mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences cancer growth is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are the major metabolites produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber and are important metabolites for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by modulating various aspects of intestinal epithelial cells and leukocytes. They are usually taken up by colonocytes as an energy source, but also act as regulators in cells via direct activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Simply put, we are still lacking short and long chain fatty acids in our diet and need to be added to the diet so that immune cells can cover mutations, including the development of cancer cells. Regulation of inflammation is another mechanism that links the gut microbiota to tumor growth; any internal inflammation starts in the gut and can be suppressed by the microbiota, which will stop the tumor from growing. The mammary glands have their own microbiome and the bacteria that inhabit them. Live bacteria exist in cancer cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, a recent study has shown that the intracellular microbiota residing in the tumor promotes cancer aggressiveness and metastatic colonization by participating in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, thereby increasing their resistance to fluid shear stress upon entry into the systemic circulation.What does Biodonatum postbiotic-microbiotic do:It restores the diversity of the good microbiota and suppresses the pathogen.It restores the intestines from the inside and affects all parts of immune cells.It ensures the bioavailability and efficacy of therapy.A healthy intestinal microbiota can influence the effectiveness of treatment by directly influencing drug metabolism or shaping the host’s immune response to treatment. How does Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic work in gynecology in chronic diseases and endometriosis? Clinical studies conducted on women have shown that the microbiotic has a protective effect against endometriosis by suppressing inflammation and the development of ectopic endometrial cells.Douching with Biodonatum relieves internal inflammation and restores the vaginal flora.Taking Biodonatum orally suppresses the growth of pathogenic flora.With the help of Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic, you can treat and prevent vaginal infections (vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, fungal infections) and their relapses by douching for 14 days. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children of different ages?

When Biodonatum is prescribed for prophylactic purposes, its daily dose for children should be 15-30 drops 1-2 times a day.After a year, the dosage increases: up to 5 years from 2.5 ml to 5 ml 1 time per day; over 5 years: from 5 ml to 5 ml 2 times a day.The course of treatment with Biodonatum is 2-3 months.When introducing complementary foods, Biodonatum will help the child’s digestive system to move to a new level. It is recommended to administer Biodonatum in an age-appropriate dosage one week before the introduction of complementary foods.Early transition to artificial feeding. Children fed with formula are not given breast milk containing bifidogenic factors.It is recommended to increase the frequency of taking Biodonatum. The duration of the first course of administration is also 2-3 months at the age-appropriate dosage. In addition, during the first year of life, it is recommended to take 4 additional courses of 4 weeks at an interval of 2 months.The period of adaptation of a child in a preschool educational institution and school.To activate the body’s adaptive abilities, it is recommended to take Biodonatum 2 weeks before entering a preschool educational institution or school for 2-3 months. How to take Biodonatum Postbiotic-Microbiotic for children with autism? In children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is very different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and the brain: they cause an immune system response and increase inflammation. The next stage of ongoing research, the results of which we are waiting for, concerns the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Many studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorders. Autistic children usually have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence. Another study found that children with autism suffered from leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an over-response of the immune system and inflammation that can reach the brain. calf. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS have been observed in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this is due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of autistic patients have hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue. As we can see, many processes occur in the intestine of autistic patients, which tells us that the intestinal bacterial flora of autistic patients is very different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This is the first study to prove that a disturbance of the intestinal flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of the intestinal flora can significantly reduce the symptoms of autism.In autistic patients, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the class Clostridia, which are a very dangerous bacteria. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they trigger the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the intercellular communication process. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for normal brain function and increases oxidative stress. In the United States, leading doctors have proposed the use of nutritional supplements containing the necessary biomolecules for autistic patients. Among the elements suggested for autistic patients are L-carnitine, an amino acid important for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl and L-cysteine, which increase the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, modern doctors widely use the Japanese biotechnological supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, people with autistic disorders have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, vitamin and mineral deficiency; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; overgrowth of yeast and bacteria; leaky gut syndrome. Biodonatum is recommended for the complete elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky gut.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 sachet of 5 ml with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are food components that are not digested or absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by the microflora of the human large intestine and stimulate its growth and vital activity.The use of prebiotics can also be associated with some side effects. Thus, para-aminobenzoic acid and lysozyme, components of some prebiotics, affect blood clotting, which is undesirable in the presence of thrombosis.They have a low bioavailability of less than 1%.When taking Prebiotic, you often encounter the problem of bloating and gas formation.

Elke lichaamsplaats vertegenwoordigt een afzonderlijke habitat die biljoenen microbiële cellen en honderden stammen kan omvatten die bijna volledig variëren van de ene plaats naar de andere in het hele lichaam.“Toen zag ik bijna altijd met grote verbazing dat er in dit object veel zeer kleine levende dieren waren, die heel mooi bewogen.” Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)Hoewel er geen twijfel over bestaat dat ziektekiemen enkele van ‘s werelds grootste problemen veroorzaken (malaria, cholera, door voedsel overgedragen ziekten en andere infectieziekten), is de realiteit dat 99% van de ziektekiemen geen ziekte veroorzaakt. Er zijn veel nuttige microben die bijdragen aan de voedselproductie (bijv. brood, kaas, yoghurt, chocolade, koffie, bier); bodemproductie en -regeneratie; afbraak van verontreinigende stoffen en gifstoffen; zuurstofproductie; en de gezondheid van planten, dieren en mensen. Elk levend wezen op deze planeet heeft een microbioom… geassocieerde microben die gezondheid en welzijn ondersteunen. Microbioom is de complete set microben (bacteriën, virussen, inclusief bacteriofagen, schimmels, protozoa) en hun genen en genomen in of op het menselijk lichaam. Dat nuttige microben in en op het menselijk lichaam leven, is geen nieuw concept.Maar het kostte ons vier eeuwen om echt zo diep mogelijk naar deze microbiële gemeenschappen te kijken en ze als meer dan alleen ziekteverwekkers te zien. Met name milieumicrobiologie en microbiële ecologie en evolutie bieden een conceptueel kader voor… erkennend dat de overgrote meerderheid van de microben die in en op ons leven geen microben of ziekteverwekkers zijn, maar er wel bij horen en onze gezondheid en welzijn helpen behouden. We werken samen met onderzoeksinstituten en centra. Ons in vitro en ex vivo klinische werk stelt ons in staat om nieuwe microbiotische voordelen voor de menselijke gezondheid te ontdekken en bij te dragen aan nieuwe vooruitgang in de studie en het begrip van het microbioom en probiotische organismen. Probiotische micro-organismen hebben een enorm potentieel voor onze toekomst. Hun gebruik is zo uitgebreid dat we vandaag al op weg zijn naar wereldwijde veranderingen in de behandeling en preventie van veel ziekten. We moeten nog veel leren over onze kleine hulpvrienden die in staat zijn om problemen op planetaire schaal op te lossen die ons zullen helpen ons prachtige thuis - planeet Aarde - te behouden voor toekomstige generaties.

        "text": "Home Blog L’environnement-microbiomeL’environnement-microbiomeIl existe un lien étroit entre le microbiome humain et notre environnement externe. Trois phénomènes peuvent être identifiés qui reflètent cette relation étroite à des échelles de temps très différentes: 1. les effets des antibiotiques sur le microbiome, 2. des taux élevés de transfert horizontal de gènes entre les bactéries du microbiome et les bactéries de l’environnement, et 3. changements dans le microbiome au fil du temps évolutif. temps évolutif.L’exposition aux antibiotiques a d’énormes conséquences sur le microbiome. Premièrement, le nombre de microbes résistants aux antibiotiques augmente. Deuxièmement, il y a une augmentation du nombre de bactéries sensibles, c’est-à-dire des bactéries qui auraient pu être tuées par l’antibiotique mais qui ne l’ont pas été parce qu’elles ont acquis des gènes résistants par transfert horizontal de gènes avec leurs voisines. Troisièmement, on constate une augmentation du nombre de bactéries qui n’ont jamais été exposées à l’antibiotique parce qu’elles étaient incrustées dans le mucus ou autrement protégées de l’exposition. Il en résulte une augmentation générale du nombre de bactéries résistantes et protégées. « Dans de nombreux cas, lorsque nous prenons des antibiotiques, nous pouvons souvent causer plus de problèmes que nous n’en guérissons », « surtout lorsque nous ne suivons pas le traitement jusqu’au bout ».Le transfert horizontal de gènes (l’échange de gènes entre microbes en l’absence de reproduction sexuée) entre les bactéries du microbiome et les bactéries de l’environnement a également d’énormes conséquences sur le microbiome. Smillie et al. (2011) ont calculé le taux de transfert horizontal de gènes parmi plus de 2 000 génomes bactériens et ont signalé une fréquence plus élevée de transfert horizontal de gènes dans le microbiome humain que dans d’autres environnements, la plupart des transferts se produisant entre les microbes habitant les mêmes sites corporels (par exemple, les microbes des deux communautés microbiennes intestinales sont plus susceptibles de participer au transfert horizontal de gènes qu’un microbe intestinal et un microbe cutané). Les chercheurs ont conclu que le transfert horizontal de gènes n’est pas motivé par la proximité physique, mais plutôt par l’écologie. Surtout, ils ont également signalé que les taux les plus élevés de transfert horizontal de gènes entre les microbes associés à l’homme et les microbes non humains ont été observés chez les microbes provenant d’animaux de ferme..Enfin, comprendre le contexte évolutif du microbiome met en lumière le «lien ultime» entre le microbiome humain et notre environnement externe. En fait, il n’est pas exagéré de suggérer que non seulement les gènes ont été partagés, mais que le microbiome a également été partagé. En acquérant une partie de son microbiome auprès d’autres premiers hominidés, H. sapiens aurait pu être mieux équipé pour faire face à de nouvelles maladies infectieuses et à d’autres facteurs de stress lors de sa migration d’Afrique vers de nouveaux habitats. Certains scientifiques ont suggéré que les pratiques sociales modernes (par exemple, l’assainissement, l’eau potable, le bain, l’utilisation d’antibiotiques, les césariennes, les préparations pour nourrissons, les amalgames au mercure) créent un environnement dans lequel les microbiomes humains ne sont plus exposés à la riche diversité de microbes que nous partageons. rencontrés dans notre passé évolutif. Blaser et Falkow (2009) ont suggéré que si l’inoculum initial provient de la mère, mais que chaque génération successive de mères est plus pauvre en microbes que la précédente, alors chaque génération successive acquiert de moins en moins de microbes bénéfiques.

        "text": "Home Blog Het milieu-microbioomHet milieu-microbioomEr bestaat een nauw verband tussen het menselijke microbioom en onze externe omgeving. Er kunnen drie verschijnselen worden geïdentificeerd die deze nauwe relatie op zeer verschillende tijdschalen weerspiegelen: 1. de effecten van antibiotica op het microbioom, 2. hoge snelheden van horizontale genoverdracht tussen bacteriën in het microbioom en bacteriën in de omgeving, en 3. veranderingen in het microbioom in de loop van de evolutie. evolutionaire tijd.Blootstelling aan antibiotica heeft enorme gevolgen voor het microbioom. Ten eerste neemt het aantal antibioticaresistente microben toe. Ten tweede is er een toename van het aantal vatbare bacteriën, dat wil zeggen bacteriën die door het antibioticum gedood hadden kunnen worden, maar dat niet zijn geworden omdat ze resistentiegenen hebben gekregen via horizontale genoverdracht met hun buren. Ten derde is er een toename van het aantal bacteriën dat nooit aan het antibioticum is blootgesteld, omdat ze in het slijm zitten of op een andere manier beschermd zijn tegen blootstelling. Dit resulteert in een algemene toename van het aantal resistente en beschermde bacteriën. “Als we antibiotica slikken, veroorzaken we vaak meer problemen dan we kunnen genezen,” “vooral als we de behandeling niet tot het einde toe afmaken.”Horizontale genoverdracht (de uitwisseling van genen tussen microben zonder seksuele voortplanting) tussen bacteriën in het microbioom en bacteriën in de omgeving heeft ook enorme gevolgen voor het microbioom. Smillie et al. (2011) berekenden de snelheid van horizontale genoverdracht tussen ruim 2000 bacteriële genomen en rapporteerden een hogere frequentie van horizontale genoverdracht in het menselijke microbioom dan in andere omgevingen, waarbij de meeste overdracht plaatsvindt tussen microben die dezelfde lichaamsdelen bewonen (bijvoorbeeld microben uit beide darmmicrobiële gemeenschappen nemen waarschijnlijker deel aan horizontale genoverdracht dan een darmmicrobe en een huidmicrobe). De onderzoekers concludeerden dat horizontale genoverdracht niet wordt aangestuurd door fysieke nabijheid, maar eerder door ecologie. Belangrijk is dat ze ook meldden dat de hoogste percentages horizontale genoverdracht tussen microben die bij mensen voorkomen en niet-menselijke microben werden waargenomen bij microben van landbouwhuisdieren.Ten slotte werpt inzicht in de evolutionaire context van het microbioom licht op de ‘ultieme link’ tussen het menselijke microbioom en onze externe omgeving. Het is niet zo gek om te stellen dat niet alleen de genen, maar ook het microbioom gedeeld werden. Doordat H. sapiens een deel van zijn microbioom van andere vroege mensachtigen had overgenomen, was hij mogelijk beter toegerust om met nieuwe infectieziekten en andere stressfactoren om te gaan toen hij vanuit Afrika naar nieuwe leefgebieden migreerde. Sommige wetenschappers hebben gesuggereerd dat moderne sociale gewoonten (bijvoorbeeld sanitaire voorzieningen, schoon water, baden, antibioticagebruik, keizersneden, zuigelingenvoeding en amalgaam met kwik) een omgeving creëren waarin menselijke microbiomen niet langer worden blootgesteld aan de grote diversiteit aan microben die wij met elkaar delen. die we in ons evolutionaire verleden zijn tegengekomen. Blaser en Falkow (2009) stelden dat als het initiële inoculum afkomstig is van de moeder, maar elke opeenvolgende generatie moeders armer is aan microben dan de vorige, elke opeenvolgende generatie dan steeds minder nuttige microben verwerft.

        "text": "Home Blog AUTISMAUTISMIt is no longer a secret that the intestinal microflora is the main regulator of the brain. Now the brain and intestines are often compared in structure; they say that the intestines are the second brain of the body. Scientists have also found a mechanism in our body through which communication between the brain and intestines occurs. The connection between the gut and the brain is bidirectional, meaning that nervous experiences affect the functioning of the intestines and the condition of the intestines is reflected in the functioning of the nervous system. The gut and brain communicate through the vagus nerve, which is the longest nerve in the human body and is an information channel between the millions of nerve cells that are located in the digestive tract and central nervous system. Research has shown that gut bacteria directly influence the stimulation and function of cells along the vagus nerve. Some of the gut bacteria are capable, like neurons in the brain, of producing information-carrying chemicals that speak their language to the brain through the vagus nerve.The intestines have been called the second brain because the number of nerve cells in the stomach lining is enormous, as the vagus nerve disperses throughout the digestive system. The intestines regulate muscle activity, control immunity and hormones, and produce 80%-90% of serotonin.The gut has its own immune system, called gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which accounts for 70% of the body’s immune system. The immune system is located in the intestines, because the intestinal walls are the body’s borders with the outside world. This is where the body interacts with foreign organisms and where communication with every cell of the body’s immune system is maintained. If a cell encounters something suspicious in the intestines, it activates the body’s entire immune system.This is why it is very important to care for and maintain the integrity of the intestinal wall, since this wall is only one cell thick. Bacteria and cells work together. Intestinal bacteria monitor the situation and train the immune system in order to prevent a possible inadequate reaction to any food and provoking an autoimmune response.Scientific research in recent years has shown that pathogenic bacteria can cause the development of many diseases, for example, the already well-known bacteria Helicobacter Pylori, when actively growing, causes stomach ulcers and can cause oncological processes in the duodenum. Studies conducted with this bacterium have shown that it interacts with the immune system, including causing the production of inflammatory molecules and stress hormones, which causes the stress response system to switch into an inappropriate response mode. Pathogenic bacteria can also change the body’s response to pain, lowering the pain threshold.“Friendly” bacteria accordingly do the exact opposite. They minimize the number of pathogenic bacteria and control the number of opportunistic bacteria. They actively cooperate with the body’s immune and endocrine systems, keeping the levels of cortisol (stress hormone) and adrenaline under control.Each group of “friendly” bacteria contains many different species. The most famous, accounting for more than 90% of the population of all intestinal bacteria, are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Firmicutes bacteria are effective in extracting energy from food. They play a huge role in the absorption of fats in the body. Studies have shown that in overweight people the ratio of this bacterium is several times higher than in thin people. Higher levels of Firmicutes lead to the activation of genes that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. Changing the ratio between these two bacteria can, in fact, affect the expression of DNA. The most well-studied bacteria are Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.Is the microflora of a child suffering from autism different from the microflora of a healthy child?! Studies conducted in the USA have shown that in children with autism, the composition of the intestinal microflora is not typical for healthy children, that is, the composition of the flora is significantly different. The study also identified types of bacteria that synthesize substances that negatively affect the immune system and brain – they provoke a response from the immune system and increase inflammation. The next stage of research, which is being carried out and we are waiting for the results, is the relationship between intestinal bacteria, their by-products and the risk of developing autism.Numerous studies have already shown that diseases of the digestive tract are among the characteristic signs of autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism typically have several problems: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence. Another study found that children with autismm have leaky gut syndrome. This is a condition that can trigger an excessive immune system response and inflammation that can reach the brain. High levels of the pro-inflammatory molecule LPS were found in patients with severe autism. These molecules should not enter the bloodstream, but this occurs due to a violation of the integrity of the intestinal wall. 93% of patients with autism have enlarged lymphoid tissue. As we can see in the gut of patients with autism, there are many processes going on, which tells us that the bacterial flora of the gut of patients with autism is significantly different from that of healthy people.The thesis about the relationship between excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria and autism was put forward in 2000 by Richard Sandler. This was the first study to provide evidence that disruption of gut flora can cause autism and that restoring the normal balance of gut flora can significantly reduce autism symptoms.In patients with autism, the intestinal microflora is dominated by bacteria of the Clostridia class, which is a very dangerous bacterium. This bacterium produces propionic acid, which is toxic to the brain and also promotes intestinal permeability by weakening the tight junctions that hold the cells of the intestinal wall together. When the integrity of the intestinal wall is disrupted, propionic acid molecules can easily enter the bloodstream, where they turn on the inflammatory process and activate the immune system response. Propionic acid also disrupts the cell signaling system, disrupting the process of intercellular communication. The brain’s ability to use energy is impaired. This acid is also dangerous because it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids necessary for the normal functioning of the brain and increases oxidative stress.Leading doctors in the USA have proposed the use of nutritional supplements that contain the necessary biomolecules for patients with autism. Among the elements that have been suggested for patients with autism are L-carnitine, an important amino acid for brain function, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as N-acetyl, L-cysteine, which increase glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is a major antioxidant for the brain and helps control oxidative damage and inflammation. To restore the balance of intestinal microflora as necessary nutrition, Russian doctors and doctors in the CIS countries widely use the biotechnological Japanese supplement Biodonatum in their daily clinical practice. As we said earlier in this article, with autistic disorders people have the following health problems: weakened Th1 Th2 immunity; malnutrition and, as a result, deficiency of vitamins and minerals; violation of antioxidant protection; detoxification disorder; yeast and bacteria overgrowth; leaky gut syndrome.Biodoantum is recommended for the comprehensive elimination of these problems. Biodonatum will restore natural immunity, replenish vitamin deficiencies, restore antioxidant protection, increase the growth of its own beneficial microflora and reduce the growth of yeast and pathogenic bacteria, and due to a large number of more than 500 active metabolites, it will “close” the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms through a leaky intestine.Biodonatum should be taken 3 times a day according to the following scheme: 1 5 ml sachet with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before meals, in the middle of the day 1 5 ml sachet with 30 ml of water at room temperature during meals and in the evening 1 5 ml sachet with 30 ml of water at room temperature 20 minutes before bedtime.A course of treatment is recommended 2 times a year in the fall for 12 weeks and in the spring for 12 weeks.

In 2019, the company conducted research with one of the leading laboratories, Life Length, which is located in Madrid. This laboratory is engaged in research on the activation of telomerase. In 2009, American Elizabeth Blackburn received the Nobel Prize for proving the influence of telomere length on prolonging active longevity and youth. What are telomeres?! Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, when we are born we have 15,000 base pairs, we grow up, and the ends gradually become smaller and smaller. Telomeres perform several important functions, such as:Ensure genome stability.Protect the cell from death, mutations, and aging.Protect the structure of the terminal sections of chromosomes during cell division.The research conducted by the company had several goals:Assess the safety profile of Biodonatum.See how Biodonatum affects the natural proliferation of cells.Assess whether Biodonatum activates telomerase.Does Biodonatum protect cells?The study was carried out on fibroplast cells, since they are identical to enterocyte cells (intestinal cells).Amazing results were obtained:After 6 hours, cells treated with Biodonatum showed +40% telomerase activation.The study showed that Biodonatum is a 100% organic product with a high safety profile, including for pregnant women and newborns.Biodonatum does not affect natural proliferation (cell division), thus does not provoke the development of cancer.Biodonatum has a protective effect on the cell, in other words, telomeres shorten 2.5 times slower.The study showed that cells need 8 weeks to restore telomere length and reduce the level of critically short telomeres in the body.The dosage regimen, dosage and duration are prescribed by the attending physician.

But everyone understands how the intestines affect the beauty and youth of the skin. Many people visit cosmetologists, which is justified and sometimes far from budgetary; others try to take various dietary supplements for the intestines and use home treatments, which is far from effective. Good quality leather is, first of all, good texture. Due to an unbalanced diet, a polluted environment, stress and other factors, the condition of the intestinal microflora worsens, in other words, the good microflora is sharply reduced in quantity and the active growth of pathogenic or conditionally pathogenic flora begins, which leads to the release of toxic gases by these bacteria. Next, the following mechanism is launched: gases enter the blood, affecting the circulatory system, which leads to a decrease in metabolism in the body. The body cannot absorb and assimilate the received nutrients, vitamins and microelements, which naturally affects a woman’s appearance, the quality of her skin, nails and hair. In order to avoid the picture described above, we need to maintain our microflora, then good bacteria will contribute to the absorption and assimilation by the body of nutrients, vitamins and microelements, which are important for maintaining healthy skin, nails and hair.B&S Corporation has conducted a number of placebo-controlled studies in women. The study involved 75 women aged 30 to 45 years, who took Biodonatum 10 ml daily for 30 days. After taking Biodonatum, 65% of participants showed improvements in the following indicators: skin texture improved in 65% of women, skin hydration improved in 92% of women, acne and inflammation were eliminated in 81% of women, skin elasticity improved in 75% of women. Also, 65% of women showed improvements in criteria related to gastric performance indicators, such as improved intestinal perilstatics, in 68% of women constipation disappeared and daily bowel movements normalized.Biodonatum in this study was taken orally by women.

        "text": "Home Blog Biodonatum for CovidBiodonatum for CovidToday, all of humanity is faced with a pandemic that we had never even imagined before. No one could ever imagine that every country would be locked down, that all air traffic would be stopped, and that tomorrow we, our body, our immune system would have to survive and adapt. Before the pandemic, we talked a lot about this, but put little into practice. COVID-19 has shown us: the importance of preventing viral diseases, the timeliness of therapy and the invaluableness of rehabilitation, which will become a new step in recovery after suffering from the virus. What is COVID-19 and how to protect yourself from it is a very pressing and multifaceted question of today.So, COVID-19 has been known for a very long time; animals, including pets, have always been sick. Close interest in coronaviruses began in 2002 in China, when there was an epidemic of SARS and the causative agent was named the sars-cov-2 virus. The virus was transmitted by bats. The story that many of us know about the expensive coffee that Kopi Luwak animals eat and defecate on, and this coffee is considered the most expensive and elite is the absolute truth, this is how the virus was transmitted to humans.COVID-19 is an RNK virus that is covered with a protein shell with spikes, which is why the virus is called coronovirus. Due to these spikes, the virus is transmitted very quickly, which is its distinctive feature.Most people experience this virus in a mild form, but if a person has chronic diseases, oncology, or cardiac diseases, there is a high risk of developing a serious illness such as pneumonia. The virus is not stable in the environment, which is why distance between people, wearing a mask, signets, washing hands and using disinfectant solutions are at the top of the list of preventive measures.Prevention with Biodonatum is fitness for the immune system. It is important to maintain balance in the body, because if immunity is high, we get a cytokine storm, which develops during the course of the disease; if immunity is low, we get chronic diseases, so balance and harmony of the immune system is very important. For this, leading Russian experts recommend prophylactic use of Biodonatum from 1 to 3 sachets per day for 12 weeks.COVID-19 develops in each person according to its own scenario, which is why, at the beginning of the pandemic, the world’s leading experts were concerned about the implementation of protocols and treatment standards. Today, doctors have developed treatment protocols in their arsenal, but these protocols will undergo changes with the release of new vaccines and drugs. Despite the general opinion that medicine was not ready to work with this virus, this is a general misconception. As stated earlier, the virus was known and understood by doctors and scientists. Scientists know the receptors to which the virus attaches – these are the upper respiratory tract, alveoli, pancreatic receptors and others. They clearly understand what happens to the human body when a virus is introduced, what the virus affects, and in what severe forms it can manifest itself. Based on a large amount of information and the course of each patient’s disease, a treatment regimen is selected. The basic drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are azithromycin and hydroxychlorophyll. It is these drugs that affect the immune system, reducing the synthesis of interleukins.Prescribed drugs suppress the immune system. Each of these drugs has toxicity that leads to changes in liver parameters. The drugs pass through the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea, so drugs are needed to normalize the flora of the gastrointestinal tract. Biodoantum belongs to precisely such drugs. European doctors use Biodonatum as an accompanying therapy to the main treatment regimen. The recommended dosage regimen is 3 sachets per day. The sachet is diluted in 30-50 ml of water at room temperature and taken throughout the day during the entire course of treatment.After suffering from COVID-19, schemes for rehabilitation and restoration of the body have already been developed. For each patient, an individual, multifactorial rehabilitation program is drawn up, which includes physical activity, breathing practices and meditation, restorative massages and immune restoration.Biodonatum is aimed at restoring the immune system after COVID-19. Many scientific works have shown the influence of intestinal microflora on the functioning of the whole organism. Today we understand that by regulating the functioning of the intestines, we can restore immunity. Biodoantum suppresses the growth of putrefactive bacteria, maintaining a certain Ph, lysates of lactobacilli are built into the intestinal walls and the microbiota system, restoring the body literally at the cellular level.The recommended dose of Biodonatum during the rehabilitation period is 1-2 sachets per day for 21 days.

The child is reflected physically and spiritually The condition of the parents at the time of conception. Then during pregnancy the child is influenced by the mother’s moods, her desires and character, as well as her way of life. After birth, the child begins to imitate his parents, and for many years his development was entirely dependent on them.”Mahatma GandhiPregnancy is one of the most difficult and beautiful periods in the life of every woman. Pregnancy, despite its ghostly beauty, tests the activity of every organ and the woman’s entire body as a whole. All functions of a woman’s body change during pregnancy and adapt to serve the fetus. Some changes that occur become obvious, such as the growth of the abdomen and enlargement of the mammary glands. Other changes are more hidden, such as changes in microflora, but they have a strong impact on the body of the expectant mother.Doctors and healers of the past considered pregnancy as a disease lasting 9 months. The modern attitude of doctors towards pregnancy is increasingly progressive, as they have new, unique drugs in their arsenal that affect the quality of life of a pregnant woman without harming her and the child.Hormonal changes that occur in a woman lead to toxicosis, irritability and fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, dry skin and swelling, as well as constipation. B&S Corporation, together with Kayo Sato, Professor of Medical Care in Obstetrics and Gynecology, conducted placebo-controlled studies in a group of pregnant women (18 women took part) on the following indicators: constipation, hypersensitivity, fatigue, fluid balance. 18 pregnant women took Microbiotic Biodonatum for 30 days and were tested according to 28 criteria recorded in the clinical trial design.The results that were obtained exceeded all expectations. Taking Biodonatum eliminated the cause of constipation and flatulence. All participants felt positive dynamics in relation to other symptoms, such as: decreased sensitivity to cold, lack of bloating, improved skin condition (hydration balance, skin color, reduction of inflammation and rashes). Taking Biodonatum also significantly alleviated or eliminated the symptoms of toxicosis in women and improved their quality of life.During pregnancy, Biodonatum is prescribed both orally and vaginally (douching).The dosage regimen, dosage and duration are prescribed by the attending physician.

Hugo“Children are the flowers of life” – everyone knows this expression. Children decorate our lives and fill it with meaning. We rejoice at their arrival, take care of them during their growth and development, and strive to give them the best, providing them with a high standard of living. The standard of living for us and our children depends on the conditions and microclimate in which we live. The environment, food, water, air – all this affects our health. Unfortunately, with the growth of technological progress, the environment is deteriorating, which leads to an increase in the birth rate of autistic children. If in 1995 1 autistic child was born out of 5,000 newborn children, then in 2018 1 autistic child was born out of 50 newborn children. The numbers speak for themselves. Why does this happen, what causes this disease? Primarily, it is caused by environmental influences and genetic predisposition (mutations). The following significant influencing factors are: perinatal infection, taking medications during pregnancy, stress, pregnancy after 40 years. It has been clinically proven that microbiota affects all vital processes in the body, especially during pregnancy. The development of a child’s brain occurs in parallel with the development of his microbiota. Microbiota communicates with the brain, also a proven scientific fact. The microbiota communicates with the brain through the immune system through cytokines, metabolites and the gut neuroendocrine system, stress hormones acting on the gut and through afferent and efferent neuronal pathways. In autism, immune dysfunction and gastrointestinal dysfunction occur, affecting all the main processes in the body. The metabolism of tryptophan changes in the body. There is a change in metabolites in the blood. Scientists have determined which bacteria influences the development of autism. This is a bacterium of the Clostridium class.B&S Corporation conducted placebo-controlled studies among autistic children. The study included 23 children aged 5 to 7 years. All children had similar complaints in their medical history, such as: constant abdominal pain similar to intestinal colic, frequent constipation, delayed physical, psychomotor and speech development. At the age of 3 years, minimal vocabulary and reduced speech understanding were noted. A stool test for dysbacteriosis was performed and excessive growth of bacteria of the Clostridium class was detected. In the analysis, bacteria of the Lactobacillus class were completely absent and bacteria of the Bifidobacterium class were significantly reduced. I was prescribed Biodonatum for 30 days and received amazing results. Children began to go to the toilet regularly, pain and colic disappeared, their mood improved, children began to walk more, play and interact with the outside world, as a result of which their vocabulary and understanding of speech began to expand. The hysterics stopped. A repeat stool analysis was done, which showed a decrease in bacteria of the Clostridium class, an increase in bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium classes.The dosage regimen, dosage and duration are prescribed by the attending physician.

        "text": "Home Blog Biodonatum for LongevityBiodonatum for LongevityToday, in the 21st century, we are opening a new chapter in the history of the health of our species. Longevity, which we strive for, is not the only indicator of health. Important indicators of health are quality of life, physical and psychological health. All these factors depend on our little friends – microbes. Today, we know that the appendix, once thought to be a useless relic of our evolutionary past, actually serves as a “sanctuary” for microbes, a place where the body’s immune system is trained and given guidance for action. We ourselves constantly harm our microflora, and when we do this, the balance of the entire system is disrupted, which leads to inflammation, and inflammation causes chronic disease. Research conducted after sequencing human DNA has shown that many of the genetic diseases belong to genes associated with the permeability of the intestinal walls and the control of the immune system. Our alliance with microbes is threatened by several things: uncontrolled use of antibiotics, lack of fiber in our diets, and a change in the way in which children’s microflora is traditionally nurtured (switching from breastfeeding to formula). Today we can correct this situation and eliminate all threats together with Biodonatum. Biodonatum helps us benefit from beneficial bacteria, making them our allies in the fight against dangerous bacteria. Resisting aggression from pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella. Biodonatum helps to further strengthen the defensive lines already created by the body with the help of a specialized composition that is suitable for each person, since it is equal to the native microflora and helps the body fight infections or weaken the course of inflammatory processes. It is also important to understand that the human body’s reaction to a particular drug is often unpredictable, since 4.4 million additional microflora genes play an extremely important role in this process. Microbes can activate and inactivate medications and even make them toxic.You and I are certainly lucky, since our health depends only on us. The microbes for which our body is their home belong entirely to us, and only we can form and cultivate their colonies, taking care of them. Choose foods and medications with microbes in mind, take care of them, and they will reciprocate. If you have children, feed them breast milk. We have freedom of choice and, by controlling our microflora, we control the most complex processes involved in controlling the body. Microflora is an invisible organ, which, unlike all others, lacks constancy. Throughout evolution, we have evolved side by side with microbes, and we are unable to live without them. Love your microbes, because together with them you have come a long way, millions of years long, and Biodonatum will help you establish an invisible, but very strong connection with them.

This is the only way to separate the deepest truth from equally deep misconceptions.” Carl SaganFor many years, we have underestimated the role of microorganisms living in our body – bacteria, but modern science is completely changing our view of them. Microorganisms control our health and today this is a proven fact. This became obvious after sequencing human DNA. A person has 21,000 genes. The human body is home to 100 trillion bacteria, which have 4.4 million genes.Biodoantum is a modern Microbiotic with proven clinical effectiveness, reflecting the global trend of the role of the human Microbiome and its influence on the entire body. Biodoantum can be confidently attributed to the modern achievements of microbiology, because the state of a person’s microflora affects his weight, the smooth functioning of the immune system, mental health, mood and even the choice of people around us, including the choice of a life partner. The cause of many ailments that surround a modern person living in a metropolis in conditions of constant stress, such as: obesity, autism, mental illness, panic attacks, eating disorders, allergies, autoimmune disorders and oncology should be sought in the inability to take care of loyal, invisible, but reliable assistants – our microbes.Modern Microbiotic Biodoantum – opens up new horizons of modern medicine for us and claims that we are able to influence the state of microorganisms in the direction we need.Biodoantum is a product of the decay of the cell walls of probiotic microorganisms, as well as products of their metabolite in whey (soy milk). Biodoantum contains short peptides, free amino acids, monosaccharides (glucose, galactose), volatile fatty acids, a large amount of vitamins B, C, PP, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium and the bacteria themselves, broken down by hydrolysis into small “fragments” – fractions of cytoplasm, cell walls (peptidoglycans). Today, Biodoantum is used to prevent seasonal and colds, in combined treatment regimens and as a means of rehabilitation after COVID-19. Biodoantum has a 100% safety profile and no toxicity, and clinical studies have approved its use by pregnant women and newborns. The regimen, dosage and duration are prescribed by the attending physician.

        "text": "Home Blog Flatulence, Constipation, BloatingFlatulence, Constipation, BloatingOur digestive system performs an incredibly complex job: absorbing and digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating what is not absorbed from the body. More than two dozen organs take part in the digestion process. The digestive system can be called a “full cycle system”, since it works autonomously from the absorption of food to the removal of undigested residues. It is very important that each element of the system works smoothly, like a clockwork, and does not fail.Gastrointestinal diseases are among the most common pathologies in the world. According to WHO forecasts, by the middle of the 21st century, gastrointestinal diseases will occupy one of the leading places in the world. Why does this happen, you ask?! The answer is obvious. Gastrointestinal diseases are caused by the lifestyle of modern people, stress, bad habits, unbalanced diet, environmental pollution and the emergence of genetically modified food products.The gastrointestinal tract is the first in contact with our environment, bacteria and toxins. Gastrointestinal bacteria can be called “border guards” who guard our health and reliably protect us. Because it is the microbiota that protects us from aggressive environmental factors.The composition of our microflora directly affects diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common complaints related to gastrointestinal diseases are constipation and diarrhea. These are the ones we encounter to a greater or lesser extent throughout our lives.Gastrointestinal diseases can be organic or functional in nature. There are diseases that provoke constipation or diarrhea; such diseases include inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal cancer, and polyps.Functional gastrointestinal disorders are most often associated with “sluggish” intestines. Against the background of the growth of pathogenic flora in the body, chronic inflammation occurs. Against the background of inflammation, contact between cells is disrupted, the intestines seem to move apart and a distance appears between the epithelial cells, the intestines increase in volume, which leads to pain.Constipation is most often associated with irritable bowel syndrome and has several symptoms: bloating, flatulence and pain.The reason that leads to constipation is impaired intestinal motility and changes in intestinal microflora. This occurs due to the fact that feces stagnate and pathogenic microflora develops.In our body, the composition of microflora can be divided into opportunistic flora, pathogenic flora and friendly flora. Pathogenic flora are those bacteria that cause disease. Opportunistic flora are organisms that are present in moderate quantities, their growth is controlled by friendly flora. Friendly flora are lacto and bifidobacteria. Increased growth of opportunistic flora leads to inflammation and various diseases. For example, the well-known bacterium Helicobacter pylori leads to various diseases, such as gastritis, ulcers and oncology. Clinical studies have been conducted that show that lactobacilli can reduce the level of Helicobacter pylori.Now let’s talk about diarrhea. Diarrhea also occurs as a result of disruption of the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract; the digestion process is significantly accelerated, which leads to dilution of feces and frequent bowel movements.It is important to understand that diarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom. The main cause of diarrhea is an infectious factor: dirty hands, the famous traveler’s diarrhea, viral infections. Once in the gastrointestinal tract, pathogenic microorganisms begin to multiply rapidly, releasing toxins, which lead to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and disruption of its functions, such as the absorption of water and nutrients. Diarrhea leads to a host of complications: dehydration, loss of electrolytes, and much more.To solve problems with gastrointestinal diseases, medications that will affect intestinal motility and microflora are mandatory. That is why, when treating gastrointestinal diseases, protocols include drugs that normalize the intestinal microflora.Such drugs include probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics and new generation drugs Postbiotic-Microbiotic. An article published on our website about probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotics will help you understand the difference between these drugs.In short, a probiotic is lacto and bifidobacteria, which belong to the normal human microflora. The probiotic acts on the flora that is in the lumen. More than 80% of the probiotic is excreted in transit through feces and is not retained in the body. Prebiotics – food for friendly flora. Symbiotic – bacteria that enter the body along with “probiotic + prebiotic food”. Microbiotic – fermented bacteria. This form is most favorable for integration into the epithelium, into the intestinal wall flora. The microbiotic does not disrupt the film that has already been created and exists in the intestines. Fermented bacteria are congruent with the bacteria that already existin the intestines.Thus, solving the problems of the gastrointestinal tract, Biodonatum helps restore the intestinal microflora and change the pH of the intestines, acidifying the intestinal flora, reducing the number of putrefactive bacteria and giving nutrition and growth to friendly microflora.How to maintain your microflora?! Consume Microbiotics as they minimize the effects of taking antibiotics or junk food. In addition, studies have shown that lactobacilli help improve mood and increase resistance to stress. Eat more fruits and vegetables as they provide fiber to your body. Don’t get carried away with antibiotics, and when the doctor next tries to prescribe you an antibiotic, don’t hesitate to ask the question, is this really advisable? Broad-spectrum antibiotics are especially dangerous, since they do not see the difference between “theirs” and “theirs,” destroying your microflora at the same time. Eat right, do not eat processed foods or deep-frozen foods, as antimicrobial preservatives are added to them so that they can be stored for as long as possible. These supplements work in the same way as antibiotics; when they enter the body, they destroy friendly bacteria along with pathogenic ones. Avoid stress, as stress stimulates inflammation and reduces the population of microorganisms. Stress kills a large number of friendly bacteria and creates conditions for the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. Stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga, and mindfulness reduce the risk of inflammation and maintain a diverse and stable intestinal flora.The dosage regimen, dosage and duration are prescribed by the attending physician.

        "text": "Home Blog Microbiotic for GynecologyMicrobiotic for GynecologyThe female body is unique, because life is nothing more than the female, maternal womb. The ovaries store all the eggs ever created by a woman’s body. Many people believe that ovaries are necessary only for reproduction, no – this is not so. The ovaries, as well as the stomach, are in constant dialogue with the brain. They are the ones who produce hormones and with age their role in the female body only increases.The ovaries are part of the endocrine system and produce two main hormones: estrogen and progesterone. The exchange of hormonal signals between the brain and ovaries began even before the girl began to take your first steps. Being at a non-reproductive age, the girl was focused on studying the whole diversity of life. A little later, at about 10 years old, she received an injection of sex hormones and suddenly began to notice that some of the guys from the yard or in the class were cute. This was just a test of the pen before moving on to a more intense flow of hormones from the ovaries.When a girl becomes a young woman, her menstrual cycle brings with it waves of hormones: estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. Hormones greatly influence a woman’s well-being on different days of the month, while keeping her in fighting shape. Until the age of 35, a woman’s body practically does not change, the brain works hard, maintaining mental acuity, the arteries remain healthy and clean.Women’s health is greatly influenced by the birth or absence of children. When a woman is pregnant, her body undergoes countless changes over the course of nine months. Research shows that having a child has a beneficial effect on a woman’s body and reduces the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. But motherhood carries risks in terms of a woman’s emotional well-being. It is generally accepted that every 7 young mothers suffer from postpartum depression. Studies have shown that the first year after childbirth is psychologically more difficult than divorce, job loss, or even the death of a partner.Depression and stress can lead to many other health problems, so it is important for women to take care of their physical and mental health at the same time.Women’s health has many different problems throughout life. The most common problems faced by the female reproductive system are vaginitis, cystitis, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, and decreased libido. One of the main reasons is changes in the vaginal microflora.The vaginal microflora is essentially a separate “world”, which is a complex dynamically changing micro-ecosystem. The vagina contains 100,000,000 bacteria per gram of discharge. The vaginal microflora is closely related to the intestinal microflora, therefore many diseases of the gastrointestinal tract lead to the development of dysbiosis. The wall of the rectum is in close contact with the wall of the vagina, so bacteria can easily pass through it. That is why, with severe intestinal dysbiosis, the vaginal microflora will be disrupted.Vaginal dysbiosis can be triggered by various sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.To treat vaginal dysbiosis, it is necessary to take into account two factors, such as the population of the vagina with friendly microflora and restoration of the immunity of the vaginal wall. The treatment regimen should be selected in each specific case based on test results. In the first part of therapy, the growth of pathogenic flora is suppressed, and already in the second part of therapy, when the pathogen is maximally suppressed, therapy is prescribed to restore the flora. Products for restoring vaginal microflora include Microbiotic Biodonatum, which is used according to the following scheme:Vaginal candidiasis.Douching: 5 ml of Biodonatum must be diluted with 10 ml of saline solution and douching before bedtime for 14 days.Bacterial candidiasis.Douching: 10 ml of Biodonatum must be diluted with 20 ml of saline solution and douching before bedtime for 14 days.The next step to healthy intestinal microflora is immunity of the vaginal wall. The immune system of the vaginal wall controls the vaginal microflora, preventing the growth of opportunistic bacteria and other organisms. That is why local immunocorrection is used in therapy. The microbiotic Biodonatum is used both in complex and mono therapy.Oral administration: 5 ml 3 times a day: in the morning, in the middle of the day and before bedtime (regardless of meals) for 4 – 6 weeks.The course of treatment for vaginal dysbiosis is 3 weeks, but can be increased based on the results of your tests.Take care of your women’s health and get examined every 6 months.

        "text": "Home Blog Probiotic, Prebiotic, MicrobioticProbiotic, Prebiotic, MicrobioticLet’s understand the concepts of what a probiotic, prebiotic, symbiotic and microbiotic are!?The term Probiotic means “for life”, and the term Antibiotic means “against life”.The very first Probiotic appeared! Ilya Mechnikov received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908. He proved the benefits of beneficial lactobacilli and their effect on life expectancy. Based on this, it is enough for us to simply formulate the concept of what a Probiotic is. Probiotics are live microorganisms that cause improvements in health. The first Probiotics were obtained by fermenting milk, yogurt was obtained, a little later, closer to the 40s of the 20th century, the first capsule, powder Probiotic was obtained. Today, there is a huge variety of probiotic preparations with different types of bacterial strains and with different quantitative concentrations. The bacteria that make up the Probiotics are representatives of the normal human microflora and produce lactic acid. A group of scientists from Israel proved that capsule Probiotics do not work. They made a cocktail of 11 strains of bacteria and asked volunteers to take it for 1 month. Then the experiment participants took samples from various parts of the stomach, as well as the large and small intestines. Scientists determined where the bacteria managed to form stable colonies and what changes this led to intestinal activity. The results were published in the journal CELL and they showed that in 50% of cases, the bacteria that entered the body immediately left it naturally, in the other 50% they stayed in the body for a short time, without having any significant effect.Now let’s answer the question, what are Prebiotics!? Prebiotics are substances that are not digested by enzymes in the human gastrointestinal tract. How are they useful, you ask?! The fact is that they are able to stimulate the growth of beneficial human microflora, reducing the risk of developing dysbiosis. Prebiotics are organic compounds that provide favorable conditions for the growth of natural intestinal microflora. They reach the intestines unchanged, since they are not digested by enzymes in the stomach and become food for bacteria. In theory, everything looks just fine, but what actually happens. We get quite a lot of Prebiotics from food, because Prebiotics include complex carbohydrates, as well as vegetables and fruits, such as beets and bananas. In order to get the required dose of Prebiotic, you need to eat kilograms of vegetables and fruits every day, so the world was offered a capsule Prebiotic, similar to Probiotic. The funny thing about the story is that the capsule Prebiotic does not have a significant effect on the human body.The next group is Symbiotic. Symbiotic is Pro and Prebiotic together. The idea when creating Symbiotic was that beneficial bacteria are delivered to the human body with their food in one capsule. Since bacteria enter the body with “nutrition” for their growth, this combination allows Proiotic to provide a beneficial effect more fully and effectively.Several years ago, a new term Postbiotic or Microbiotic was introduced into use. Postbiotics are products of metabolism or vital activity of microorganisms that have high biological activity in relation to the human body. Postbiotics refer to biotechnological production, where bacterial strains are first subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis for several weeks and then left to ferment for several months to 1 year. This process makes it possible to obtain bacterial lysates, ensuring the preservation of amino acids and vitamins, while eliminating the toxic effect.A long process of enzymatic hydrolysis allows for purer extraction under mild conditions.Biodonatum contains 16 strains of lacto and bifidobacteria. At the first stage of production, bacteria are divided into 4 groups according to the degree of their compatibility with other strains and pronounced physiological and biochemical properties. At the first stage of enzymatic hydrolysis, the growth of colonies of lacto and bifidobacteria occurs.Enzymatic lysates in Biodonatum are a product of the breakdown of the cell walls of probiotic microorganisms, as well as the products of their metabolite in whey (soy milk). Lysates contain short peptides, free amino acids, monosaccharides (glucose, galactose), volatile fatty acids, large amounts of vitamins B, C, PP, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium and the bacteria themselves, broken down by hydrolysis into small “fragments” – fractions of cytoplasms, cell walls.Our company consists of several production sites: a laboratory for the cultivation of strains of lacto and bifido bacteria, our own soybean fields, which are located in an environmentally friendly area, and a production site. Soybean fields are not treated with fertilizers or pesticides, so the product has a 100% safety profile.That is why Biodonatum is 100% organicskim and safe product.The standard course of Biodonatum for the prevention of ARVI and boosting immunity is 1-2 sachets per day for 8 weeks.

        "text": "Home Blog Des Propriétés du microbiomeDes Propriétés du microbiome“Qui est là?” et “Que font-ils?” Il a été suggéré qu’au lieu d’un microbiome « ​​central », il pourrait y avoir des fonctions biologiques « essentielles » du microbiome. Les études microbiotiques ont démontré des changements métaboliques importants dans le microbiome, même si les populations microbiennes réelles n’ont changé que « légèrement ». La même chose s’applique au yaourt, a-t-il déclaré. Lorsque les gens consomment du yaourt, les plusieurs milliards de microbes contenus dans ce yaourt ne modifient pas la composition des plusieurs milliards de microbes de votre microbiome. Cependant, ils provoquent d’énormes changements métaboliques.Des données récentes suggèrent que seule la moitié environ du microbiome intestinal est réellement active à un moment donné. Il peut donc être utile de connaître la part du microbiome qui est active. Non seulement certains microbes sont actifs et d’autres non, mais certains sont plus actifs que d’autres. “Comme pour toute écologie, il existe des espèces très communes qui ne font pas grand-chose, et des espèces rares qui constituent réellement l’épine dorsale de l’écologie.”Le microbe intestinal est capable de produire de la riboflavine (vitamine B2), ce qui soulève des questions sur la quantité de riboflavine fournie par notre microbiome par rapport à la quantité que nous obtenons par l’alimentation, et sur les substrats ou nutriments qui stimulent cette production. Il convient de noter que les microbes intestinaux produisent non seulement des vitamines, mais entrent également en compétition pour le fer, d’autres nutriments et les calories, en particulier chez les nourrissons.

        "text": "Home Blog Des risques de maladieDes risques de maladieLes interactions complexes entre le microbiome et son hôte créent bien plus qu’un simple risque différentiel de maladie. Ils créent également des phénotypes métaboliques différentiels (Holmes et al., 2008a). En fait, les risques de maladie et les phénotypes métaboliques sont liés à la fois biologiquement et statistiquement, de sorte que le risque de maladie peut être évalué en mesurant les niveaux de métabolites. L’analyse des métabolites relève de la « métabonomie », c’est-à-dire « la mesure quantitative des réponses métaboliques multiparamétriques (dépendantes du temps) de systèmes complexes à un stimulus physiopathologique ou à une modification génétique » (Nicholson et al.). al., 1999).La complexité des informations obtenues à partir de profils métaboliques étendus provient du fait que non seulement toutes les cellules humaines produisent des métabolites (avec plus de 500 types de cellules fonctionnellement distincts), mais que toutes les cellules microbiennes le font également (Nicholson et al., 2005). . Les microbes produisent des acides gras à chaîne courte, des acides biliaires et des oxystérols associés, des amines vasoactives (aromatiques), des crésols et des acides aromatiques, des endocannabinoïdes et d’autres molécules.De nombreux métabolites microbiens sont impliqués dans le métabolisme humain. Par exemple, les acides biliaires, qui sont des molécules de signalisation essentielles à l’hôte, sont co-métabolisés par les microbes, ce qui a un impact significatif sur le risque de maladies du foie et du côlon (Nicholson et Wilson, 2003). Les acides biliaires sont synthétisés quotidiennement dans le foie, puis sécrétés dans l’intestin des mammifères, où ils sont déconjugués en acide biliaire par les Lactobacillus et d’autres microbiotes intestinaux. L’acide cholique, à son tour, peut être déshydroxylé par d’autres microbes en acide désoxycholique. L’acide désoxycholique est à la fois hépatotoxique et cancérigène. Le cométabolisme microbien des acides biliaires influence également la biodisponibilité des lipides.Lorsqu’on réfléchit à la façon dont le microbiome intestinal influence le métabolisme humain, il est courant de penser au traitement du côlon distal et à la production d’acides gras à chaîne courte, mais le microbiome joue également un rôle important dans la partie supérieure de l’intestin, par exemple à travers les lipides. biodisponibilité.Un autre ensemble de preuves démontrant que le microbiome joue un rôle clé dans le métabolisme humain provient d’études de chirurgie bariatrique chez l’animal et chez l’homme. Le pontage gastrique Roux-en-Y (RYGB), l’étalon-or de la chirurgie bariatrique, est associé à une réduction de 80 pour cent de l’incidence du diabète dans les 24 heures suivant la chirurgie. Cette procédure est également associée à un risque réduit de cancer du côlon et d’autres cancers. Étant donné que le diabète se guérit immédiatement (c’est-à-dire et non après une perte de poids ultérieure), il doit y avoir une explication biochimique à cela. Une partie de l’explication réside probablement dans le microbiome. Zhang et al (2009) ont signalé une augmentation significative du nombre de gammaprotéobactéries chez les patients RYGB par rapport aux individus normaux et obèses. En utilisant un modèle de rat, Li et al. (2011b) ont également signalé une augmentation de l’abondance des gammaprotéobactéries ainsi que des changements massifs dans le métabolisme des acides biliaires après le RYGB. Bien que les changements dans le microbiome ne soient peut-être pas la « clé » pour comprendre le lien entre la chirurgie bariatrique et les changements dans le risque de diabète, de cancer ou d’autres maladies, « ils font certainement partie de la boîte de vitesses » (Holmes et al., 2011).

        "text": "Home Blog La médecine personnaliséeLa médecine personnaliséeLes solutions de soins de santé personnalisées nécessitent une approche systémique intégrative pour comprendre la biocomplexité humaine. La recherche sur le microbiome est un élément clé de cette approche (Nicholson, 2006) (encadré 2-1). Les gènes ne sont qu’un élément de l’interaction des gènes, de l’alimentation et des microbes qui font des humains le « supersystème » qu’ils sont. Ainsi, même si les études d’association pangénomique (GWAS), par exemple, sont très populaires, elles ne sont pas toujours, selon les mots de Jeremy Nicholson, « extrêmement révélatrices », car la signification statistique a souvent très peu à voir avec la signification biologique.Cela ne veut pas dire que les études sur la complexité du génome humain au niveau systémique ne fournissent pas d’informations intéressantes. Ils sont. Par exemple, Loscalzo et al. (2007) ont utilisé une approche systémique pour montrer que presque toutes les maladies humaines sont génétiquement liées, le ou les mêmes gènes étant impliqués dans différents troubles. Cependant, comprendre le génome humain en soi ne suffit pas pour concrétiser le concept de soins de santé personnalisés ou « de précision » (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Le microbiome représente un autre niveau de connexion génétique. Le défi pour l’avenir est de « penser à des couches de réseaux au-dessus des réseaux ». Autrement dit, comment le(s) réseau(s) du génome humain interagissent-ils avec le(s) réseau(s) du génome du microbiome à la fois dans le temps et dans l’espace ? “C’est vraiment un problème assez difficile”, “probablement le problème de biologie le plus difficile du 21e siècle”.L’un des objectifs d’une compréhension systématique de la biocomplexité humaine est la mise en œuvre du concept de soins de santé personnalisés ou « de précision » (Mirnezami et al., 2012). La métabonomie pharmaceutique est une composante de cette préoccupation. Pharmacétabonomique comme « prédiction du résultat quantitatif ou de l’effet d’une intervention biomédicale basée sur un modèle métabolique de pré-traitement ». L’approche repose sur le concept d’« hyperespace métabolique », où la position d’une personne dépend de nombreux facteurs (gènes, alimentation, microbiome) (Nicholson et Wilson, 2003). Plus deux personnes sont proches dans l’hyperespace métabolique, plus elles sont physiologiquement similaires et plus elles sont susceptibles de se comporter de la même manière face à un problème (comme un médicament ou une autre intervention thérapeutique). À titre d’exemple d’applications pharmacobonomiques potentielles, Clayton et al. (2006) ont démontré que la toxicité des médicaments pouvait être prédite sur la base des profils métaboliques urinaires pré-intervention.Outre la toxicité des médicaments, le profilage métabolique pré-intervention a également été utilisé pour prédire le métabolisme des médicaments. Par exemple, Clayton et ses collègues (2009) ont démontré un lien entre les métabolites microbiens intestinaux et le métabolisme de l’acétaminophène (Tylenol), les schémas d’excrétion microbienne déterminant en partie si un individu a un taux faible ou élevé de sulfate. La sulfatation est l’une des deux principales voies du métabolisme de l’acétaminophène, les sulfates faibles étant de mauvais métaboliseurs. Nicholson a expliqué que les clostridies et d’autres microbes produisent du 4-crésol, un analogue structurel de l’acétaminophène, qui sature le système de sulfatation pour former un sulfate faible. De plus, le 4-crésol entre en compétition pour la sulfatation non seulement avec l’acétaminophène, mais également avec tous les médicaments hydroxylés. Nicholson a déclaré : « Cela affecte des centaines de composés différents. Une enzyme microbienne intestinale a en réalité un effet surprenant sur les schémas métaboliques et est potentiellement toxique pour un très grand nombre de médicaments. »Il est intéressant de noter que les enfants autistes ne peuvent pas sulfater l’acétaminophène (Alberti et al., 1999). En fait, la capacité à sulfater l’acétaminophène est l’un des tests les plus statistiquement significatifs pour l’autisme. Encore une fois, il existe des preuves d’un lien microbien. Finegood et al (2002) ont démontré des clostridies anormales chez les enfants autistes. Altieri et ses collègues (2011) ont montré que les enfants autistes ont des niveaux de crésol microbien beaucoup plus élevés que les enfants normaux.

        "text": "Home Blog Icône du projet microbiome humainIcône du projet microbiome humainIl existe aujourd’hui un projet international sur le microbiome humain dont l’objectif est de caractériser la composition génomique de tous les microbes habitant le corps humain. Aujourd’hui déjà, notre microbiome a identifié des propriétés universelles associées à la nature dynamique du microbiome au fil du temps ou à la façon dont le microbiome modifie sa composition au cours de la vie d’une personne. Par exemple, une propriété universelle clé est que, contrairement au génome humain, le microbiome humain est acquis à nouveau à chaque génération, les enfants nés par voie vaginale acquérant des microbiomes différents de ceux des enfants nés par césarienne (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010).Les grands ensembles de données collectés montrent différents niveaux de diversité microbienne, en fonction du niveau taxonomique, dans différents sites corporels (par exemple, les échantillons vaginaux présentent moins de diversité microbienne au niveau du genre que d’autres sites corporels, mais une plus grande diversité au niveau de l’espèce).Les scientifiques du monde entier travaillent sur une approche intégrative au niveau des systèmes pour comprendre la santé humaine et les maladies, ainsi que sur l’étude du microbiome, qui est au cœur de cette approche (Mirnezami et al., 2012 ; Nicholson, 2006). Ce n’est qu’en comprenant comment les microbes intestinaux signalent et fonctionnent, notamment en ce qui concerne leurs effets sur l’hôte humain, que les scientifiques pourront un jour élucider suffisamment la biocomplexité humaine pour concrétiser le concept de soins de santé personnalisés.Depuis 2017, le microbiome humain est reconnu comme un organe à part entière.

        "text": "Home Blog Le microbiomeLe microbiomeLes scientifiques ont identifié les propriétés « universelles » du microbiome. Premièrement, le microbiote humain est réacquis à chaque génération, à la naissance. Les nouveau-nés sont comme des « aimants à germes ». Les bébés nés par voie vaginale acquièrent un microbiome différent de celui des bébés nés par césarienne, l’inoculum principal pour les bébés nés par voie vaginale étant le microbiome vaginal de la mère et pour les bébés nés par césarienne, la peau de la mère ou la peau environnante. Le fait que le microbiome soit acquis à nouveau à chaque génération contraste fortement avec le génome humain, qui est hérité.La deuxième propriété universelle est que chaque partie du corps adulte possède une composition de communauté microbienne distincte. Les données montrent le regroupement de certains taxons microbiens sur des sites spécifiques du corps, tels que la peau, l’intestin, la cavité buccale, les voies respiratoires ou les voies urogénitales, quels que soient le sexe, l’âge, le poids ou toute autre caractéristique de l’hôte. La composition de la communauté microbienne est déterminée par la localisation corporelle. « Le microbiome humain est probablement similaire à de nombreux autres écosystèmes microbiens de la planète. »Cependant, les voies métaboliques microbiennes sous-jacentes sont pratiquement les mêmes dans les différents sites du corps. Ainsi, bien que chaque site corporel possède son propre complexe microbien, tous ces complexes, quelle que soit leur composition, semblent fonctionner de la même manière en ce qui concerne le métabolisme.Une dernière propriété universelle du microbiome humain est que le microbiome intestinal change tout au long de la vie, le microbiome des personnes âgées (65 ans et plus) étant très différent de celui des adultes d’âge moyen. Dans le cadre du projet ELDERMET7, Claesson et al. (2011) ont signalé une proportion plus élevée de Bacteroidetes, une plus grande diversité taxonomique microbienne globale et une plus grande variabilité interindividuelle de la composition taxonomique microbienne chez les personnes âgées par rapport aux adultes d’âge moyen. Chez les nourrissons, la continuité microbienne au cours des 1 à 2 premières années de vie commence à changer avec la transition vers une alimentation plus variée (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), contrairement à la relative stabilité observée chez les enfants allaités. Finalement, dès la deuxième année de vie, la composition taxonomique du microbiome intestinal se stabilise et l’intestin développe ce qui semble être le microbiome adulte (Palmer et al., 2007).En effet, plus la classification taxonomique est fine, plus la composition microbienne est variable selon les individus.Chacun de nous possède ses propres « microbes personnels » qui « confèrent à chacun de nous certaines propriétés », mais on ne sait pas encore clairement quelles sont ces propriétés.

        "text": "Home Blog Connexion environnement-microbiomeConnexion environnement-microbiomeIl existe un lien étroit entre le microbiome humain et notre environnement externe. Trois phénomènes peuvent être identifiés qui reflètent cette relation étroite à des échelles de temps très différentes : (1) les effets des antibiotiques sur le microbiome, (2) des taux élevés de transfert horizontal de gènes entre les bactéries du microbiome et les bactéries de l’environnement, et (3 ) changements dans le microbiome au fil du temps évolutif.L’exposition aux antibiotiques a d’énormes conséquences sur le microbiome. Premièrement, le nombre de microbes résistants aux antibiotiques augmente. Deuxièmement, il y a une augmentation du nombre de bactéries sensibles, c’est-à-dire des bactéries qui auraient pu être tuées par l’antibiotique mais qui ne l’ont pas été parce qu’elles ont acquis des gènes résistants par transfert horizontal de gènes avec leurs voisines. Troisièmement, on constate une augmentation du nombre de bactéries qui n’ont jamais été exposées à l’antibiotique parce qu’elles étaient incrustées dans le mucus ou autrement protégées de l’exposition. Il en résulte une augmentation générale du nombre de bactéries résistantes et protégées. “Dans de nombreux cas, lorsque nous prenons des antibiotiques, nous pouvons souvent causer plus de problèmes que nous n’en guérissons”, “surtout lorsque nous ne suivons pas le traitement jusqu’au bout”.Le transfert horizontal de gènes (l’échange de gènes entre microbes en l’absence de reproduction sexuée) entre les bactéries du microbiome et les bactéries de l’environnement a également d’énormes conséquences sur le microbiome.

(2011) ont calculé le taux de transfert horizontal de gènes parmi plus de 2 000 génomes bactériens et ont signalé une fréquence plus élevée de transfert horizontal de gènes dans le microbiome humain que dans d’autres environnements, la plupart des transferts se produisant entre les microbes habitant les mêmes sites corporels ( par exemple, les microbes des deux communautés microbiennes intestinales sont plus susceptibles de participer au transfert horizontal de gènes qu’un microbe intestinal et un microbe cutané). Les chercheurs ont conclu que le transfert horizontal de gènes n’est pas motivé par la proximité physique, mais plutôt par l’écologie. Surtout, ils ont également signalé que les taux les plus élevés de transfert horizontal de gènes entre les microbes associés à l’homme et les microbes non humains ont été observés chez les microbes provenant d’animaux de ferme.Enfin, comprendre le contexte évolutif du microbiome met en lumière le « lien ultime » entre le microbiome humain et notre environnement externe. “En fait, il n’est pas exagéré de suggérer que non seulement les gènes ont été partagés, mais que le microbiome a également été partagé.” En acquérant une partie de son microbiome auprès d’autres premiers hominidés, H. sapiens aurait pu être mieux équipé pour faire face à de nouvelles maladies infectieuses et à d’autres facteurs de stress lors de sa migration d’Afrique vers de nouveaux habitats. Certains scientifiques ont suggéré que les pratiques sociales modernes (par exemple, l’assainissement, l’eau potable, le bain, l’utilisation d’antibiotiques, les césariennes, les préparations pour nourrissons, les amalgames au mercure) créent un environnement dans lequel les microbiomes humains ne sont plus exposés à la riche diversité de microbes que nous partageons. rencontrés dans notre passé évolutif. Blaser et Falkow (2009) ont suggéré que si l’inoculum initial provient de la mère, mais que chaque génération successive de mères est plus pauvre en microbes que la précédente, alors chaque génération successive acquiert de moins en moins de microbes bénéfiques.

Microbiome is the complete set of microbes (bacteria, viruses, including bacteriophages, fungi, protozoa) and their genes and genomes in or on the human body. That beneficial microbes live in and on the human body is not a new concept. But it took us four centuries to really look at these microbial communities as deeply as possible and look at them as more than just pathogens.

Already today, our microbiome has identified universal properties that are associated with the dynamic nature of the microbiome over time or with how the microbiome changes its composition over the course of a person’s life. For example, one key universal property is that, unlike the human genome, the human microbiome is acquired anew in each generation, with children born vaginally acquiring different microbiomes than children born by cesarean section (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010).Large datasets collected show varying levels of microbial diversity, depending on taxonomic level, in different body sites (e.g., vaginal samples have less microbial diversity at the genus level than other body sites, but greater diversity at the species level).Scientists around the world are working on an integrative systems-level approach to understanding human health and disease and the study of the microbiome, which is central to this approach (Mirnezami et al., 2012; Nicholson, 2006). Only by understanding how gut microbes signal and otherwise function, especially in relation to their effects on the human host, will scientists ever be able to elucidate human biocomplexity enough to realize the concept of personalized healthcare.Since 2017, the human microbiome has been recognized as a separate organ.

        "text": "Home Blog Microbiome propertiesMicrobiome propertiesScientists have identified the “universal” properties of the microbiome. Firstly, the human microbiota is acquired anew in each generation, at birth. Newborns are like “germ magnets.” Babies born vaginally acquire a different microbiome than babies born by cesarean section, with the primary inoculum for babies born vaginally being the mother’s vaginal microbiome and for babies born by cesarean section the mother’s skin or surrounding skin. Wednesday. The fact that the microbiome is acquired anew with each generation is in stark contrast to the human genome, which is inherited.The second universal property is that each part of the adult body has a distinct microbial community composition. The data show the clustering of certain microbial taxa at specific body sites, such as the skin, intestine, oral cavity, respiratory tract, or urogenital tract, regardless of sex, age, weight, or any other characteristics of the host. The composition of the microbial community is determined by body location. The human microbiome is likely similar to many other microbial ecosystems on the planet.However, the underlying microbial metabolic pathways are virtually the same across different body sites. Thus, although each body site has its own unique microbial complex, all of these complexes, regardless of composition, appear to function similarly with regard to metabolism.A final universal property of the human microbiome is that the gut microbiome changes throughout life, with the microbiomes of older adults (65 years and older) being very different from those of middle-aged adults. As part of the ELDERMET7 project, Claesson et al. (2011) reported a higher proportion of Bacteroidetes, greater overall microbial taxonomic diversity, and greater interindividual variability in microbial taxonomic composition among older adults compared with middle-aged adults. In infants, microbial continuity during the first 1–2 years of life begins to change with the transition to a more varied diet (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), in contrast to the relative stability observed in breastfed children. Eventually, by the second year of life, the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome stabilizes and the gut develops what appears to be the adult microbiome (Palmer et al., 2007).In fact, the finer the taxonomic classification, the more variable the microbial composition among individuals.Each of us has our own personal microbes  that “give each of us certain properties, but it is not yet clear what these properties are.

        "text": "Home Blog The connection between the environment and the microbiomeThe connection between the environment and the microbiomeThere is a strong connection between the human microbiome and our external environment. Three phenomena can be identified that reflect this close relationship across very different time scales: (1) the effects of antibiotics on the microbiome, (2) high rates of horizontal gene transfer between bacteria in the microbiome and bacteria in the environment, and (3) changes in the microbiome over time. evolutionary time.Exposure to antibiotics has enormous consequences for the microbiome. First, the number of antibiotic-resistant microbes is increasing. Second, there is an increase in the number of susceptible bacteria, that is, bacteria that could have been killed by the antibiotic but were not killed because they acquired resistant genes through horizontal gene transfer with their neighbors. Third, there is an increase in the number of bacteria that were never exposed to the antibiotic because they were embedded in the mucus or otherwise protected from exposure. The result is a general increase in the number of resistant and protected bacteria. “In many cases, when we take antibiotics, we can often cause more problems than we cure,” “especially when we do not take the full course of treatment.”Horizontal gene transfer (the exchange of genes between microbes in the absence of sexual reproduction) between bacteria in the microbiome and bacteria in the environment also has enormous consequences for the microbiome. Smillie et al. (2011) calculated the rate of horizontal gene transfer among more than 2000 bacterial genomes and reported a higher frequency of horizontal gene transfer in the human microbiome than in other environments, with most transfer occurring among microbes inhabiting the same sites body (e.g., microbes from the two gut microbial communities are more likely to participate in horizontal gene transfer than a gut microbe and a skin microbe). The researchers concluded that horizontal gene transfer is not driven by physical proximity, but rather by ecology. Importantly, they also reported that the highest rates of horizontal gene transfer between human-associated and non-human microbes were observed in microbes from farm animals.Finally, understanding the evolutionary context of the microbiome sheds light on the “ultimate connection” between the human microbiome and our external environment. It’s actually not a stretch to suggest that not only were the genes shared, but the microbiome was shared. By acquiring some of its microbiome from other early hominids, H. sapiens may have been better equipped to deal with new infectious diseases and other stressors as it migrated from Africa to new habitats. Some scientists have suggested that modern social practices (eg, sanitation, clean water, bathing, antibiotic use, cesarean sections, formula feeding, mercury amalgams) create an environment in which human microbiomes are no longer exposed to the rich diversity of microbes that we share encountered in our evolutionary past. Blaser and Falkow (2009) suggested that if the initial inoculum comes from the mother, but each successive generation of mothers is more microbially depleted than the previous one, then each successive generation acquires fewer and fewer beneficial microbes.

        "text": "Home Blog Personalized medicinePersonalized medicinePersonalized healthcare solutions require an integrative, systems approach to understanding human biocomplexity. Microbiome research is a key component of this approach (Nicholson, 2006) (Box 2-1). Genes are just one component of the interaction of genes, diet and microbes that make humans the “supersystem” that they are. So while genome-wide association studies (GWAS), for example, are very popular, they are not always, in Jeremy Nicholson’s words, “extremely revealing” because statistical significance often has very little to do with biological significance.This does not mean that studies of the complexity of the human genome at the systems level do not provide interesting information. They are. For example, Loscalzo et al. (2007) used a systems-level approach to show that almost all human diseases are genetically linked, with the same gene(s) implicated in different disorders. However, understanding the human genome per se is not enough to realize the concept of personalized or “precision” healthcare (Mirnezami et al., 2012). The microbiome represents another level of genetic connection. The challenge for the future is to “think about layers of networks on top of networks.” That is, how does the human genome network interact with the microbiome genome network both in time and space? It’s really quite a difficult problem, probably the most difficult problem in biology of the 21st century.One of the goals of a systematic understanding of human biocomplexity is the implementation of the concept of personalized or “precision” health care (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Pharmaceutical metabonomics is one component of this concern. Pharmacetabonomics as “prediction of the quantitative outcome or effect of a biomedical intervention based on a pre-treatment metabolic model.” The approach is based on the concept of “metabolic hyperspace”, where a person’s position depends on many factors (genes, diet, microbiome) (Nicholson and Wilson, 2003). The closer two people are in metabolic hyperspace, the more physiologically similar they are and the more likely they are to behave similarly when faced with a problem (such as a drug or other therapeutic intervention). As an example of potential pharmacobonomic applications, Clayton et al. (2006) demonstrated that drug toxicity could be predicted based on preintervention urinary metabolic profiles.In addition to drug toxicity, preintervention metabolic profiling has also been used to predict drug metabolism. For example, Clayton et al. (2009) demonstrated a link between gut microbial metabolites and acetaminophen (Tylenol) metabolism, with patterns of microbial excretion partly determining whether an individual is low or high sulfate. Sulfation is one of the two major pathways of acetaminophen metabolism, with weak sulfates being poor metabolizers. Nicholson explained that clostridia and other microbes produce 4-cresol, a structural analogue of acetaminophen, which saturates the sulfation system to form a weak sulfate. Moreover, 4-cresol competes for sulfation not only with acetaminophen, but also with all hydroxylated drugs. Nicholson said: “It affects hundreds of different compounds. One gut microbial enzyme actually has a surprising effect on metabolic patterns and is potentially toxic to a very large number of drugs.”Interestingly, children with autism cannot sulfate acetaminophen (Alberti et al., 1999). In fact, the ability to sulfate acetaminophen is one of the most statistically significant tests for autism. Again, there is evidence of a microbial connection. Finegood et al (2002) demonstrated abnormal clostridia in children with autism. Altieri et al. (2011) showed that children with autism have much higher levels of microbial cresol than normal children.

        "text": "Home Blog Disease risksDisease risksThe complex interactions between the microbiome and its host create more than just differential disease risk. They also create differential metabolic phenotypes (Holmes et al., 2008a). In fact, disease risks and metabolic phenotypes are related both biologically and statistically, so disease risk can be assessed by measuring metabolite levels. Metabolite analysis falls under the scope of “metabonomics,” that is, “the quantitative measurement of multiparametric (time-dependent) metabolic responses of complex systems to a pathophysiological stimulus or genetic modification” (Nicholson et al.). al., 1999).The complexity of the information obtained from extended metabolic profiles stems from the fact that not only do all human cells produce metabolites (with over 500 functionally distinct cell types), but so do all microbial cells (Nicholson et al., 2005). Microbes produce short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and related oxysterols, vasoactive (aromatic) amines, cresols and aromatic acids, endocannabinoids and other molecules.Many microbial metabolites are involved in human metabolism. For example, bile acids, which are critical host signaling molecules, are co-metabolized by microbes, which has a significant impact on the risk of liver and colon diseases (Nicholson and Wilson, 2003). Bile acids are synthesized in the liver daily and then secreted into the mammalian intestine, where they are deconjugated into bile acid by Lactobacillus and other gut microbiota. Cholic acid, in turn, can be dehydroxylated by other microbes to deoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is both hepatotoxic and carcinogenic. Microbial cometabolism of bile acids also influences lipid bioavailability.When thinking about how the gut microbiome influences human metabolism, it is common to think about the processing of the distal colon and the production of short-chain fatty acids, but the microbiome also plays an important role in the upper gut, for example through lipid bioavailability.Another body of evidence that the microbiome plays a key role in human metabolism comes from bariatric surgery studies in both animals and humans. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), the gold standard of bariatric surgery, is associated with an 80% reduction in the incidence of diabetes within 24 hours of surgery. This procedure is also associated with a reduced risk of colon and other cancers. Since diabetes is cured immediately (that is, and not after subsequent weight loss), there must be a biochemical explanation for this. Part of the explanation likely lies in the microbiome. Zhang et al (2009) reported a significant increase in Gammaproteobacteria in RYGB patients compared with normal and obese individuals. Using a rat model, Li et al. (2011b) also reported an increase in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria as well as massive changes in bile acid metabolism after RYGB. Although changes in the microbiome may not be the “key” to understanding the connection between bariatric surgery and changes in the body’s risk of diabetes, cancer or other diseases, “they are certainly part of the gearbox” (Holmes et al., 2011).

Microbiotic studies have demonstrated significant metabolic changes in the microbiome, even though actual microbial populations changed only “slightly.” The same applies to yogurt. When people consume yogurt, the several billion microbes in that yogurt do not change the composition of the several trillion microbes in your microbiome. However, they cause huge metabolic changes.Recent evidence suggests that only about half of the gut microbiome is actually active at any given time, so it may be useful to know how much of the microbiome is active. Not only are some microbes active and others not, but some are more active than others. As with any ecology, there are some very common species that don’t do much, and there are some rare species that are really the backbone of the ecology”The gut microbe is capable of producing riboflavin (vitamin B2), raising questions about how much riboflavin our microbiome supplies versus how much we get through diet, and what substrates or nutrients stimulate this production. It’s worth noting that gut microbes not only produce vitamins, but also compete for iron, other nutrients and calories, especially in infants.

Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)Hoewel er geen twijfel over bestaat dat microben enkele van de ernstigste problemen ter wereld veroorzaken (malaria, cholera, door voedsel overgedragen ziekten en andere infectieziekten), veroorzaakt in feite 99% van de microben geen ziekten.Er zijn veel nuttige microben die bijdragen aan de voedselproductie (bijvoorbeeld brood, kaas, yoghurt, chocolade, koffie, bier); bodemproductie en regeneratie; ontbinding van verontreinigende stoffen en toxines; zuurstofproductie; en de gezondheid van planten, dieren en mensen.“Elk levend wezen op deze planeet heeft een microbioom… geassocieerde microben die de gezondheid en het welzijn ondersteunen.” Een microbioom is een complete set van microben (bacteriën, virussen, inclusief bacteriofagen, schimmels, protozoa) en hun genen en genomen in of op het menselijk lichaam.

        "text": "Home Blog Microbiome EigenschappenMicrobiome EigenschappenWetenschappers hebben de “universele” eigenschappen van het microbioom geïdentificeerd. Ten eerste wordt de menselijke microbiota bij elke generatie, bij de geboorte, opnieuw verworven. Pasgeborenen zijn als “microbiële magneten”. Baby ‘s die van nature worden geboren, krijgen een ander microbioom dan baby’ s die door een keizersnede worden geboren, waarbij het primaire inoculum voor baby ‘s die van nature worden geboren het vaginale microbioom van de moeder is en voor baby’ s die door een keizersnede worden geboren, de huid of omgeving van de moeder.Het feit dat het microbioom in elke generatie opnieuw wordt verworven, staat in schril contrast met het menselijk genoom, dat wordt geërfd. De tweede universele eigenschap is dat elk deel van het volwassen menselijke lichaam een ​​bijzondere samenstelling heeft microbiële gemeenschap.De gegevens tonen clustering van bepaalde microbiële taxa in bepaalde delen van het lichaam, zoals de huid, darmen, mondholte, luchtwegen of urogenitale tractus, ongeacht geslacht, leeftijd, gewicht of andere indicatoren van de gastheer. De samenstelling van de microbiële gemeenschap wordt bepaald door de locatie van het lichaam. “Het menselijk microbioom is waarschijnlijk vergelijkbaar met veel andere microbiële ecosystemen op de planeet.”De onderliggende microbiële metabolische routes zijn echter vrijwel hetzelfde op verschillende lichaamslocaties. Dus, elk deel van het lichaam zijn eigen unieke microbiële complex heeft, lijken al deze complexen, ongeacht de samenstelling, hetzelfde te functioneren met betrekking tot het metabolisme. De laatste universele eigenschap van het menselijk microbioom is dat het darmmicrobioom gedurende het hele leven verandert, terwijl de microbiomen van oudere mensen (65 jaar en ouder) heel anders zijn dan de microbiomen van volwassenen van middelbare leeftijd. In het kader van het ELDERMET7-project hebben Claesson et al. (2011) meldde een groter aandeel Bacteroidetes, een groter total microbiële taxonomische diversiteit en grotere individuele variabiliteit van microbiële taxonomische samenstelling bij ouderen in vergelijking met mensen van middelbare leeftijd. Bij zuigelingen begint de microbiële continuïteit tijdens de eerste 1-2 levensjaren te veranderen met de overgang naar een meer divers dieet (Yatsunenko et al.,2012), in tegenstelling tot de relatieve stabiliteit die wordt waargenomen bij kinderen die borstvoeding krijgen. Uiteindelijk, tegen het tweede levensjaar, stabiliseert de taxonomische samenstelling van het darmmicrobioom, en wat een het microbioom van volwassenen ontwikkelt zich in de darm (Palmer et al., 2007).In feit, hoe fijner de taxonomische indeling, hoe variabeler de microbiële samenstelling tussen individuen.Ieder van ons heeft zijn eigen “persoonlijke microben” die “ieder van ons bepaalde eigenschappen geven”, maar het is nog niet duidelijk wat deze eigenschappen zijn.

        "text": "Home Blog Het milieu-microbioomHet milieu-microbioomDe bestaande nauwe band tussen het menselijk microbioom en onze externe omgeving. Er kunnen drie verschijnselen worden onderscheiden die deze nauwe relatie op zeer verschillende tijdschalen weerspiegelen: (1) het effect van antibiotica op het microbioom, (2) de hoge snelheid van horizontale genoverdracht tussen bacteriën in het microbioom en bacteriën in het milieu, en (3) veranderingen in het microbioom in de loop van de evolutionaire tijd. Blootstelling van antibiotica heeft grote gevolgen voor het microbioom.Ten eerste neemt het aantal antibioticaresistente microben toe. Ten tweede is er een toename van het aantal gevoelige bacteriën, dat wil zeggen bacteriën die door het antibioticum hadden kunnen worden gedood, maar niet zijn gedood omdat ze resistente genen hebben verkregen door horizontale genoverdracht met hun buren. Ten derde is er een toename van het aantal bacteriën dat nooit aan het antibioticum is blootgesteld, omdat ze in het slijm zijn ingebed of anderszins tegen blootstelling zijn beschermd.Het resultaat is een algemene toename van het aantal resistente en beschermde bacteriën. “In veel gevallen, wanneer we antibiotica nemen, kunnen we vaak meer problemen veroorzaken dan genezen,” “vooral wanneer we niet de volledige behandeling volgen.Horizontale genoverdracht (genuitwisseling tussen microben in afwezigheid van seksuele voortplanting) tussen bacteriën in het microbioom en bacteriën in het milieu heeft ook enorme implicaties voor het microbioom. Smillie et al (2011) berekenden de snelheid van horizontale genoverdracht onder meer dan 2000 bacteriële genomen en rapporteerden een hogere frequentie van horizontale genoverdracht in het menselijke microbioom dan in andere omgevingen, waarbij de meeste overdracht plaatsvindt tussen microben die dezelfde gebieden van het lichaam bewonen (bijvoorbeeld microben van twee intestinale microbiële gemeenschappen met grotere ze hebben meer kans om deel te nemen aan horizontale genoverdracht dan een darmmicrobe en een huidmicrobe). De onderzoekers concludeerden dat horizontale genoverdracht niet wordt veroorzaakt door fysieke nabijheid, maar eerder door ecologie. Belangrijk is dat ze ook meldden dat de hoogste percentages horizontale genoverdracht tussen menselijke microben en niet-menselijke micro-organismen werden waargenomen in microben van landbouwhuisdieren.Ten slotte werpt het begrijpen van de evolutionaire context van het microbioom licht op de “ultieme verbinding” tussen het menselijke microbioom en onze externe omgeving. “In feite zou het niet overdreven zijn om aan te nemen dat niet alleen gedeelde genen werden gedeeld, maar ook het microbioom werd gedeeld.”Nadat H. sapiens een deel van zijn microbioom van andere vroege mensachtigen had ontvangen, was hij misschien beter voorbereid om met nieuwe infectieziekten en andere stressfactoren om te gaan toen hij uit Afrika naar een nieuw leefgebied migreerde. Sommige wetenschappers hebben gesuggereerd dat moderne sociale praktijken (bijvoorbeeld sanitaire voorzieningen, schoon water, baden, het gebruik van antibiotica, keizersnede, kunstmatige voeding, kwik amalgamen) een omgeving creëren waarin menselijke microbiomen niet langer worden blootgesteld aan de rijke diversiteit aan microben die ze in ons evolutionaire verleden tegenkwamen. Blaser en Falkow (2009) stelden voor dat als het eerste inoculum van de moeder komt, maar elke volgende generatie moeders meer microben heeft dan de vorige, elke volgende generatie steeds minder nuttige microben verwer. Biomarqueurs de maladies- Biomarkers voor ziektenVandaag de dag werken wetenschappers aan de volgende taken: 1. Het gebruik van microbiome signaturen als biomarkers van de aanwezigheid van ziekten; 2. Het gebruik van enterotypen om mensen te classificeren op ziekterisico of farmacokinetiek; 3. Het gebruik van antibacteriële, ontstekingsremmende geneesmiddelen en andere kleine moleculen geproduceerd door leden van de microbioom Gemeenschap voor therapeutische doeleinden; 4. Ontwikkeling van nieuwe microbiome stammen om T-cellen te stimuleren, pro-inflammatoire cytokines te produceren, de expressie van antimicrobiële factoren van de gastheer te stimuleren, de toediening van geneesmiddelen, enz.; en 5. Ontwikkeling van virom biomarkers of andere hulpmiddelen die virom gebruiken voor therapeutische of diagnostische doeleinden.

        "text": "Home Blog Gepersonaliseerde geneeskundeGepersonaliseerde geneeskundeGepersonaliseerde gezondheidszorgoplossingen vereisen een geïntegreerde, systeembenadering om de menselijke biocomplexiteit te begrijpen. Microbioomonderzoek is een belangrijk onderdeel van deze aanpak (Nicholson, 2006) (Box 2-1). Genen zijn slechts één onderdeel van de interactie van genen, voeding en microben die mensen tot het ‘supersysteem’ maken dat ze zijn. Dus hoewel genoombrede associatiestudies (GWAS) bijvoorbeeld erg populair zijn, zijn ze niet altijd, in de woorden van Jeremy Nicholson, ‘extreem onthullend’, omdat statistische significantie vaak heel weinig te maken heeft met biologische significantie. Dit betekent niet dat studies naar de complexiteit van het menselijk genoom op systeemniveau geen interessante informatie opleveren. Zij zijn. Loscalzo et al. (2007) gebruikten bijvoorbeeld een benadering op systeemniveau om aan te tonen dat bijna alle ziekten bij de mens genetisch verbonden zijn, waarbij dezelfde genen betrokken zijn bij verschillende aandoeningen. Het begrijpen van het menselijk genoom op zichzelf is echter niet voldoende om het concept van gepersonaliseerde of ‘precieze’ gezondheidszorg te realiseren (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Het microbioom vertegenwoordigt een ander niveau van genetische verbinding. De uitdaging voor de toekomst is om “na te denken over lagen van netwerken bovenop netwerken.” Dat wil zeggen: hoe interageert het (de) menselijk genoomnetwerk met het microbioomgenoomnetwerk, zowel in tijd als in ruimte? “Het is echt een behoorlijk moeilijk probleem”, “waarschijnlijk het moeilijkste probleem in de biologie van de 21e eeuw.”Een van de doelen van een systematisch begrip van de menselijke biosimilariteit is het implementeren van het concept van gepersonaliseerde of “nauwkeurige” medische zorg (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Farmaceutische metabonomics is een van de componenten van dit probleem. Farmacetabonomics als “het voorspellen van de kwantitatieve uitkomst of het effect van een biomedische interventie op basis van een metabolisch model voorafgaand aan de behandeling”. De benadering is gebaseerd op het concept van “metabolische hyperspace”, waarbij de positie van een persoon afhangt van vele factoren (genen, dieet, microbioom) (Nicholson en Wilson, 2003). Hoe dichter twee mensen zich in de metabole hyperruimte bevinden, hoe fysiologisch meer ze op elkaar lijken en hoe groter de kans dat ze zich op dezelfde manier gedragen wanneer ze worden geconfronteerd met een probleem (bijvoorbeeld medicatie of andere therapeutische interventie). Als voorbeeld van een mogelijke farmacetabonomische toepassing, Clayton et al. (2006) heeft aangetoond dat de toxiciteit van het geneesmiddel kan worden voorspeld op basis van de metabole profielen van urine vóór interventie.Naast de toxiciteit van het geneesmiddel werd ook metabole profilering vóór de interventie gebruikt om het geneesmiddelmetabolisme te voorspellen. Bijvoorbeeld Clayton et al. (2009) toonde de relatie tussen microbiële metabolieten van de darm en het metabolisme van paracetamol (tylenol) aan, terwijl de aard van microbiële uitscheiding gedeeltelijk bepaalt of een persoon zwak of sterk “sulfaat”is. Sulfatie is een van de twee belangrijkste wegen van paracetamolmetabolisme, waarbij zwakke sulfaters slechte metabolisatoren zijn. Nicholson legde uit dat clostridia en andere microben 4-cresol produceren, een structurele analogie van paracetamol, die het sulfatiesysteem verzadigt en een zwak sulfaat vormt. Bovendien concurreert 4-cresol niet alleen met paracetamol om sulfatie, maar ook met alle gehydroxyleerde geneesmiddelen. Nicholson zei: “Het beïnvloedt honderden verschillende verbindingen. Eén intestinale microbiële enzym heeft eigenlijk een verbazingwekkend effect op de aard van het metabolisme en is mogelijk giftig voor een zeer groot aantal geneesmiddelen.”Interessant is dat kinderen met autisme acetaminophen niet kunnen sulfaat (Alberti et al., 1999). In feite is het vermogen om paracetamol te sulfaat een van de meest statistisch significante tests voor autisme. Nogmaals, er is bewijs van een microbiële verbinding. Faingood et al. (2002) abnormale clostridia bij kinderen met autisme aangetoond. Altieri et al. (2011) toonde aan dat kinderen met autisme veel hogere niveaus van cresol hebben die door microben worden geproduceerd dan normale kinderen.

        "text": "Home Blog Risico ' s van ziektenRisico ' s van ziektenDe complexe interacties tussen het microbioom en zijn gastheer creëren iets meer dan alleen een differentieel risico op ziekte. Ze creëren ook differentiële metabolische fenotypen (Holmes et al., 2008a). In feite zijn ziekterisico ‘ s en metabolische fenotypen zowel biologisch als statistisch gerelateerd, dus het risico op ziekte kan worden beoordeeld door de niveaus van metabolieten te meten. De analyse van metabolieten valt onder de sfeer van “metabonomics”, dat wil zeggen “kwantitatieve meting van multiparametrische (tijdsafhankelijke) metabolische reacties van complexe systemen op een pathofysiologische prikkel of genetische modificatie” (Nicholson et al., 1999). De complexiteit van de informatie die wordt verkregen met behulp van uitgebreide metabolische profielen is te wijten aan het feit dat niet alleen alle menselijke cellen metabolieten produceren (met meer dan 500 functioneel verschillende celtypen), maar ook alle microbiële cellen (Nicholson et al., 2005). Microben produceren kortketenvetzuren, galzuren en verwante oxysterines, vasoactieve (aromatische) amines, cresolen en aromatische zuren, endocannabinoïden en andere moleculen. Veel microbiële metabolieten zijn betrokken bij het menselijk metabolisme. Galzuren, die kritische signaalmoleculen van de gastheer zijn, worden bijvoorbeeld door microben gemetaboliseerd, wat een aanzienlijke invloed heeft op het risico op lever-en darmziekten (Nicholson en Wilson, 2003). Galzuren worden dagelijks in de lever gesynthetiseerd en vervolgens in de darm van zoogdieren uitgescheiden, waar ze door Lactobacillus en andere darmmicrobiota worden gedeconjugeerd tot galzuur. Cholzuur kan op zijn beurt door andere microben worden dehydroxyleerd tot deoxycholzuur. Deoxycholzuur is zowel hepatotoxisch als kankerverwekkend. Microbiële cometabolisme van galzuren beïnvloedt ook de biologische beschikbaarheid van lipiden. Na te denken over hoe het darmmicrobioom het menselijk metabolisme beïnvloedt, is het gebruikelijk om na te denken over de verwerking van de distale dikke darm en de productie van vetzuren met een korte keten, maar het microbioom speelt een belangrijke rol in de bovenste darm, bijvoorbeeld vanwege de biologische beschikbaarheid van lipiden.Een ander bewijs dat het microbioom een sleutelrol speelt in het menselijk metabolisme is verkregen als gevolg van studies van bariatrische chirurgie bij zowel dieren als mensen. Gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), de gouden standaard van bariatrische chirurgie, wordt geassocieerd met een 80 procent vermindering van de incidentie van diabetes binnen 24 uur na de operatie. Deze procedure wordt ook geassocieerd met een verminderd risico op darmkanker en andere kankers. Aangezien diabetes onmiddellijk wordt genezen (dat wil zeggen, niet na daaropvolgend gewichtsverlies), moet er een biochemische verklaring voor zijn. Een deel van deze verklaring ligt waarschijnlijk in het microbioom. Zhang et al. (2009) meldde een significante toename van het aantal gammaproteobacteriën bij patiënten met RYGB in vergelijking met normale mensen en mensen met obesitas. Met behulp van een ratmodel, Li et al. (2011b) meldde ook een toename van het aantal gammaproteobacteriën, evenals enorme veranderingen in het galzuurmetabolisme na RYGB. Hoewel veranderingen in het microbioom misschien niet de “sleutel” zijn om de relatie tussen bariatrische chirurgie en veranderingen in het lichaam, het risico op diabetes, kanker of andere ziekten te begrijpen, “maken ze zeker deel uit van de versnellingsbak” (Holmes et al., 2011).

Microbiotische studies hebben significante metabolische veranderingen in het microbioom aangetoond, ook al veranderden de werkelijke microbiële populaties slechts ‘in geringe mate’. Hetzelfde geldt voor yoghurt, zei hij. Wanneer mensen yoghurt consumeren, veranderen de miljarden microben in die yoghurt de samenstelling van de miljarden microben in je microbioom niet. Ze veroorzaken echter enorme metabolische veranderingen. Recent bewijs suggereert dat slechts ongeveer de helft van het darmmicrobioom op een bepaald moment daadwerkelijk actief is, dus het kan nuttig zijn om te weten hoeveel van het microbioom actief is. Niet alleen zijn sommige microben actief en andere niet, maar sommige zijn actiever dan andere. “Zoals bij elke ecologie zijn er enkele veel voorkomende soorten die niet veel doen, en er zijn enkele zeldzame soorten die echt de ruggengraat van de ecologie vormen.”De darmmicrobe is in staat riboflavine (vitamine B2) te produceren, wat vragen oproept over hoeveel riboflavine ons microbioom levert versus hoeveel we via de voeding binnenkrijgen, en welke substraten of voedingsstoffen deze productie stimuleren. Het is vermeldenswaard dat darmmicroben niet alleen vitamines produceren, maar ook strijden om ijzer, andere voedingsstoffen en calorieën, vooral bij zuigelingen.

Eine zentrale universelle Eigenschaft besteht beispielsweise darin, dass das menschliche Mikrobiom im Gegensatz zum menschlichen Genom in jeder Generation neu erworben wird, wobei vaginal geborene Kinder andere Mikrobiome erwerben als per Kaiserschnitt geborene Kinder (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010).Große gesammelte Datensätze zeigen je nach taxonomischer Ebene unterschiedliche Grade der mikrobiellen Vielfalt an verschiedenen Körperstellen (z.

Erstens wird die menschliche Mikrobiota in jeder Generation bei der Geburt neu erworben. Neugeborene sind wie „Keimmagnete“. Vaginal geborene Babys erwerben ein anderes Mikrobiom als per Kaiserschnitt geborene Babys, wobei das primäre Inokulum für vaginal geborene Babys das vaginale Mikrobiom der Mutter und für per Kaiserschnitt geborene Babys die Haut der Mutter oder die umgebende Haut ist. Mittwoch. Die Tatsache, dass das Mikrobiom mit jeder Generation neu erworben wird, steht im krassen Gegensatz zum menschlichen Genom, das vererbt wird.Die zweite universelle Eigenschaft besteht darin, dass jeder Teil des erwachsenen Körpers eine unterschiedliche Zusammensetzung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft aufweist. Die Daten zeigen die Häufung bestimmter mikrobieller Taxa an bestimmten Körperstellen, wie der Haut, dem Darm, der Mundhöhle, den Atemwegen oder dem Urogenitaltrakt, unabhängig von Geschlecht, Alter, Gewicht oder anderen Merkmalen des Wirts. Die Zusammensetzung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft wird durch den Körperstandort bestimmt. Das menschliche Mikrobiom ähnelt wahrscheinlich vielen anderen mikrobiellen Ökosystemen auf dem Planeten.Allerdings sind die zugrunde liegenden mikrobiellen Stoffwechselwege an verschiedenen Körperstellen praktisch gleich. Obwohl also jede Körperstelle ihren eigenen einzigartigen mikrobiellen Komplex hat, scheinen alle diese Komplexe, unabhängig von ihrer Zusammensetzung, im Hinblick auf den Stoffwechsel ähnlich zu funktionieren.Eine letzte universelle Eigenschaft des menschlichen Mikrobioms besteht darin, dass sich das Darmmikrobiom im Laufe des Lebens verändert, wobei sich die Mikrobiome älterer Erwachsener (65 Jahre und älter) stark von denen von Erwachsenen mittleren Alters unterscheiden. Im Rahmen des ELDERMET7-Projekts haben Claesson et al. (2011) berichteten von einem höheren Anteil an Bacteroidetes, einer größeren mikrobiellen taxonomischen Diversität insgesamt und einer größeren interindividuellen Variabilität in der mikrobiellen taxonomischen Zusammensetzung bei älteren Erwachsenen im Vergleich zu Erwachsenen mittleren Alters. Bei Säuglingen beginnt sich die mikrobielle Kontinuität während der ersten 1–2 Lebensjahre mit dem Übergang zu einer abwechslungsreicheren Ernährung zu verändern (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), im Gegensatz zur relativen Stabilität, die bei gestillten Kindern beobachtet wurde. Im zweiten Lebensjahr stabilisiert sich schließlich die taxonomische Zusammensetzung des Darmmikrobioms und der Darm entwickelt scheinbar das Mikrobiom eines Erwachsenen (Palmer et al., 2007).Tatsächlich gilt: Je feiner die taxonomische Klassifizierung, desto variabler ist die mikrobielle Zusammensetzung zwischen den einzelnen Individuen.Jeder von uns hat seine eigenen Mikroben, die „jedem von uns bestimmte Eigenschaften verleihen, aber es ist noch nicht klar, was diese Eigenschaften sind.“ ContactsHead office of the company BIODONATUM TRAIDING Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Dubai Silicon Oasis, DDP, Building A1 +971543499119 info@biodonatum.com Write to us",

        "text": "Home Blog Der Umwelt und dem MikrobiomDer Umwelt und dem MikrobiomEs besteht eine starke Verbindung zwischen dem menschlichen Mikrobiom und unserer äußeren Umgebung. Es lassen sich drei Phänomene identifizieren, die diesen engen Zusammenhang über sehr unterschiedliche Zeitskalen hinweg widerspiegeln: (1) die Auswirkungen von Antibiotika auf das Mikrobiom, (2) hohe Raten des horizontalen Gentransfers zwischen Bakterien im Mikrobiom und Bakterien in der Umwelt und (3 ) Veränderungen im Mikrobiom im Laufe der Zeit. evolutionäre Zeit.Die Einwirkung von Antibiotika hat enorme Folgen für das Mikrobiom. Erstens nimmt die Zahl antibiotikaresistenter Mikroben zu. Zweitens steigt die Zahl anfälliger Bakterien, also Bakterien, die durch das Antibiotikum hätten abgetötet werden können, aber nicht abgetötet wurden, weil sie durch horizontalen Gentransfer mit ihren Nachbarn resistente Gene erworben haben. Drittens steigt die Zahl der Bakterien, die nie dem Antibiotikum ausgesetzt waren, weil sie im Schleim eingebettet waren oder auf andere Weise vor der Exposition geschützt waren. Die Folge ist ein allgemeiner Anstieg der Zahl resistenter und geschützter Bakterien. „In vielen Fällen können wir durch die Einnahme von Antibiotika oft mehr Probleme verursachen als heilen“, „vor allem, wenn wir nicht die gesamte Behandlung durchführen.“Auch der horizontale Gentransfer (der Austausch von Genen zwischen Mikroben ohne sexuelle Fortpflanzung) zwischen Bakterien im Mikrobiom und Bakterien in der Umwelt hat enorme Folgen für das Mikrobiom. Smillie et al. (2011) berechneten die Rate des horizontalen Gentransfers zwischen mehr als 2000 Bakteriengenomen und berichteten über eine höhere Häufigkeit des horizontalen Gentransfers im menschlichen Mikrobiom als in anderen Umgebungen, wobei der meiste Transfer zwischen Mikroben stattfand, die an denselben Stellen im Körper leben (z. B. Mikroben aus …). Es ist wahrscheinlicher, dass die beiden Darmmikrobengemeinschaften am horizontalen Gentransfer beteiligt sind als eine Darmmikrobe und eine Hautmikrobe. Die Forscher kamen zu dem Schluss, dass der horizontale Gentransfer nicht durch physische Nähe, sondern vielmehr durch die Ökologie gesteuert wird. Wichtig ist, dass sie auch berichteten, dass die höchsten Raten des horizontalen Gentransfers zwischen mit Menschen assoziierten und nichtmenschlichen Mikroben bei Mikroben von Nutztieren beobachtet wurden.Schließlich wirft das Verständnis des evolutionären Kontexts des Mikrobioms Licht auf die „ultimative Verbindung“ zwischen dem menschlichen Mikrobiom und unserer äußeren Umgebung. Es ist eigentlich nicht übertrieben zu behaupten, dass nicht nur die Gene, sondern auch das Mikrobiom geteilt wurden. Durch den Erwerb eines Teils seines Mikrobioms von anderen frühen Hominiden war H. sapiens möglicherweise besser für den Umgang mit neuen Infektionskrankheiten und anderen Stressfaktoren gerüstet, als er von Afrika in neue Lebensräume wanderte. Einige Wissenschaftler haben vorgeschlagen, dass moderne soziale Praktiken (z. B. Hygiene, sauberes Wasser, Baden, Verwendung von Antibiotika, Kaiserschnitte, Säuglingsnahrung, Quecksilberamalgame) eine Umgebung schaffen, in der menschliche Mikrobiome nicht länger der reichen Vielfalt an Mikroben ausgesetzt sind, die wir gemeinsam haben in unserer evolutionären Vergangenheit angetroffen. Blaser und Falkow (2009) schlugen vor, dass jede nachfolgende Generation immer weniger nützliche Mikroben erwirbt, wenn das ursprüngliche Inokulum von der Mutter stammt, jede nachfolgende Generation von Müttern jedoch stärker mikrobiell dezimiert ist als die vorherige.

        "text": "Home Blog Personalisierte MedizinPersonalisierte MedizinPersonalisierte Gesundheitslösungen erfordern einen integrativen Systemansatz zum Verständnis der menschlichen Biokomplexität. Die Mikrobiomforschung ist ein zentraler Bestandteil dieses Ansatzes (Nicholson, 2006) (Kasten 2-1). Gene sind nur eine Komponente des Zusammenspiels von Genen, Ernährung und Mikroben, die den Menschen zu dem „Supersystem“ machen, das er ist. Obwohl sich beispielsweise genomweite Assoziationsstudien (GWAS) großer Beliebtheit erfreuen, sind sie, um es mit Jeremy Nicholsons Worten zu sagen, nicht immer „extrem aufschlussreich“, da statistische Signifikanz oft sehr wenig mit biologischer Signifikanz zu tun hat.Dies bedeutet nicht, dass Studien zur Komplexität des menschlichen Genoms auf Systemebene keine interessanten Informationen liefern. Sie sind. Beispielsweise haben Loscalzo et al. (2007) verwendeten einen Ansatz auf Systemebene, um zu zeigen, dass fast alle menschlichen Krankheiten genetisch miteinander verbunden sind, wobei dasselbe Gen bzw. dieselben Gene an verschiedenen Erkrankungen beteiligt sind. Das Verständnis des menschlichen Genoms an sich reicht jedoch nicht aus, um das Konzept der personalisierten oder „präzisen“ Gesundheitsversorgung zu verwirklichen (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Das Mikrobiom stellt eine weitere Ebene der genetischen Verbindung dar. Die Herausforderung für die Zukunft besteht darin, „über Netzwerkschichten über Netzwerke nachzudenken“. Das heißt, wie interagiert das menschliche Genomnetzwerk zeitlich und räumlich mit dem Mikrobiom-Genomnetzwerk? Es ist wirklich ein ziemlich schwieriges Problem, wahrscheinlich das schwierigste Problem in der Biologie des 21. Jahrhunderts.Eines der Ziele eines systematischen Verständnisses der menschlichen Biokomplexität ist die Umsetzung des Konzepts der personalisierten oder „präzisen“ Gesundheitsversorgung (Mirnezami et al., 2012). Pharmazeutische Metabonomik ist ein Bestandteil dieses Anliegens. Pharmazetabonomik als „Vorhersage des quantitativen Ergebnisses oder der Wirkung einer biomedizinischen Intervention auf der Grundlage eines Stoffwechselmodells vor der Behandlung“. Der Ansatz basiert auf dem Konzept des „metabolischen Hyperraums“, bei dem die Position einer Person von vielen Faktoren (Genen, Ernährung, Mikrobiom) abhängt (Nicholson und Wilson, 2003). Je näher sich zwei Menschen im metabolischen Hyperraum befinden, desto ähnlicher sind sie sich physiologisch und desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass sie sich ähnlich verhalten, wenn sie mit einem Problem konfrontiert werden (z. B. einem Medikament oder einer anderen therapeutischen Intervention). Als Beispiel für mögliche pharmakobonomische Anwendungen haben Clayton et al. (2006) zeigten, dass die Arzneimitteltoxizität auf der Grundlage von Harnstoffwechselprofilen vor der Intervention vorhergesagt werden kann.Zusätzlich zur Arzneimitteltoxizität wurde das Stoffwechselprofil vor der Intervention auch verwendet, um den Arzneimittelstoffwechsel vorherzusagen. Beispielsweise haben Clayton et al. (2009) zeigten einen Zusammenhang zwischen mikrobiellen Metaboliten im Darm und dem Metabolismus von Paracetamol (Tylenol), wobei Muster der mikrobiellen Ausscheidung teilweise darüber entscheiden, ob eine Person einen niedrigen oder hohen Sulfatgehalt hat. Sulfatierung ist einer der beiden Hauptwege des Paracetamol-Stoffwechsels, wobei schwache Sulfate schlechte Metabolisierer sind. Nicholson erklärte, dass Clostridien und andere Mikroben 4-Kresol produzieren, ein Strukturanalogon von Paracetamol, das das Sulfatierungssystem sättigt und ein schwaches Sulfat bildet. Darüber hinaus konkurriert 4-Kresol nicht nur mit Paracetamol, sondern mit allen hydroxylierten Arzneimitteln um die Sulfatierung. Nicholson sagte: „Es betrifft Hunderte verschiedener Verbindungen. Ein mikrobielles Darmenzym hat tatsächlich eine überraschende Wirkung auf Stoffwechselmuster und ist potenziell toxisch für eine sehr große Anzahl von Medikamenten.“Interessanterweise können Kinder mit Autismus Paracetamol nicht sulfatieren (Alberti et al., 1999). Tatsächlich ist die Fähigkeit, Paracetamol zu sulfatieren, einer der statistisch aussagekräftigsten Tests für Autismus. Auch hier gibt es Hinweise auf einen mikrobiellen Zusammenhang. Finegood et al. (2002) zeigten abnormale Clostridien bei Kindern mit Autismus. Altieri et al. (2011) zeigten, dass Kinder mit Autismus viel höhere Werte an mikrobiellem Kresol haben als normale Kinder.

        "text": "Home Blog KrankheitsrisikenKrankheitsrisikenDie komplexen Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem Mikrobiom und seinem Wirt schaffen mehr als nur ein unterschiedliches Krankheitsrisiko. Sie erzeugen auch unterschiedliche Stoffwechselphänotypen (Holmes et al., 2008a). Tatsächlich hängen Krankheitsrisiken und metabolische Phänotypen sowohl biologisch als auch statistisch zusammen, sodass das Krankheitsrisiko durch Messung der Metabolitenspiegel beurteilt werden kann. Die Metabolitenanalyse fällt in den Bereich der „Metabonomik“, also „der quantitativen Messung multiparametrischer (zeitabhängiger) Stoffwechselreaktionen komplexer Systeme auf einen pathophysiologischen Reiz oder eine genetische Veränderung“ (Nicholson et al.). al., 1999).Die Komplexität der aus erweiterten Stoffwechselprofilen gewonnenen Informationen ergibt sich aus der Tatsache, dass nicht nur alle menschlichen Zellen Metaboliten produzieren (mit über 500 funktionell unterschiedlichen Zelltypen), sondern auch alle mikrobiellen Zellen (Nicholson et al., 2005). Mikroben produzieren kurzkettige Fettsäuren, Gallensäuren und verwandte Oxysterole, vasoaktive (aromatische) Amine, Kresole und aromatische Säuren, Endocannabinoide und andere Moleküle.Viele mikrobielle Stoffwechselprodukte sind am menschlichen Stoffwechsel beteiligt. Beispielsweise werden Gallensäuren, die wichtige Signalmoleküle des Wirts sind, von Mikroben kometabolisiert, was einen erheblichen Einfluss auf das Risiko von Leber- und Dickdarmerkrankungen hat (Nicholson und Wilson, 2003). Gallensäuren werden täglich in der Leber synthetisiert und dann in den Darm von Säugetieren ausgeschieden, wo sie von Lactobacillus und anderen Darmmikrobiota in Gallensäure dekonjugiert werden. Cholsäure wiederum kann von anderen Mikroben zu Desoxycholsäure dehydroxyliert werden. Desoxycholsäure ist sowohl hepatotoxisch als auch krebserregend. Der mikrobielle Cometabolismus von Gallensäuren beeinflusst auch die Bioverfügbarkeit von Lipiden.Wenn man darüber nachdenkt, wie das Darmmikrobiom den menschlichen Stoffwechsel beeinflusst, denkt man häufig an die Verarbeitung des distalen Dickdarms und die Produktion kurzkettiger Fettsäuren, aber das Mikrobiom spielt auch im oberen Darm eine wichtige Rolle, beispielsweise durch Lipide Bioverfügbarkeit.Ein weiterer Beweis dafür, dass das Mikrobiom eine Schlüsselrolle im menschlichen Stoffwechsel spielt, stammen aus bariatrischen Chirurgiestudien an Tieren und Menschen. Der Roux-Y-Magenbypass (RYGB), der Goldstandard der bariatrischen Chirurgie, ist mit einer 80-prozentigen Reduzierung der Diabetes-Inzidenz innerhalb von 24 Stunden nach der Operation verbunden. Dieses Verfahren ist auch mit einem verringerten Risiko für Dickdarmkrebs und andere Krebsarten verbunden. Da Diabetes sofort geheilt wird (also nicht erst nach anschließender Gewichtsabnahme), muss es dafür eine biochemische Erklärung geben. Ein Teil der Erklärung liegt wahrscheinlich im Mikrobiom. Zhang et al. (2009) berichteten über einen signifikanten Anstieg von Gammaproteobakterien bei RYGB-Patienten im Vergleich zu normalen und adipösen Personen. Mithilfe eines Rattenmodells haben Li et al. (2011b) berichteten auch über eine Zunahme der Häufigkeit von Gammaproteobakterien sowie massive Veränderungen im Gallensäurestoffwechsel nach RYGB. Obwohl Veränderungen im Mikrobiom möglicherweise nicht der „Schlüssel“ zum Verständnis des Zusammenhangs zwischen bariatrischen Operationen und Veränderungen des körpereigenen Risikos für Diabetes, Krebs oder andere Krankheiten sind, „sind sie sicherlich Teil des Getriebes“ (Holmes et al., 2011).

        "text": "Home Blog Des MikrobiomsDes Mikrobioms“Wer ist da?” und „Was machen sie?“ Es wurde vermutet, dass es anstelle eines „Kern“-Mikrobioms möglicherweise „Kern“-biologische Funktionen des Mikrobioms gibt. Mikrobiotische Studien haben erhebliche Stoffwechselveränderungen im Mikrobiom gezeigt, auch wenn sich die tatsächlichen Mikrobenpopulationen nur „geringfügig“ veränderten. Gleiches gilt für Joghurt. Wenn Menschen Joghurt konsumieren, verändern die mehreren Milliarden Mikroben in diesem Joghurt nicht die Zusammensetzung der mehreren Billionen Mikroben in Ihrem Mikrobiom. Allerdings verursachen sie enorme Stoffwechselveränderungen.Jüngste Erkenntnisse deuten darauf hin, dass jeweils nur etwa die Hälfte des Darmmikrobioms tatsächlich aktiv ist. Daher kann es hilfreich sein zu wissen, wie viel des Mikrobioms aktiv ist. Einige Mikroben sind nicht nur aktiv und andere nicht, einige sind auch aktiver als andere. Wie in jeder Ökologie gibt es einige sehr häufige Arten, die nicht viel bewirken, und es gibt einige seltene Arten, die wirklich das Rückgrat der Ökologie bilden.Die Darmmikrobe ist in der Lage, Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) zu produzieren, was die Frage aufwirft, wie viel Riboflavin unser Mikrobiom im Vergleich zu der Menge, die wir über die Nahrung aufnehmen, liefert und welche Substrate oder Nährstoffe diese Produktion stimulieren. Es ist erwähnenswert, dass Darmmikroben nicht nur Vitamine produzieren, sondern insbesondere bei Säuglingen auch um Eisen, andere Nährstoffe und Kalorien konkurrieren.

        "text": "Home Blog خصائص الميكروبيوم خصائص الميكروبيوم لقد حدّد العلماء الخصائص “العالمية” للميكروبيوم.أولاً: تُكتسب الميكروبات البشرية من جديد في كل جيل، عند الولادة. فالرضع مثل “مغناطيس للجراثيم”. الأطفال المولودون طبيعيًا (عن طريق الولادة المهبلية) يكتسبون ميكروبيوم مختلفًا عن أولئك المولودين بعملية قيصرية؛ حيث يكون الميكروبيوم المهبلي للأم هو المصدر الرئيسي للأطفال المولودين طبيعيًا، بينما يكون ميكروبيوم الجلد للأم أو الجلد المحيط بها هو المصدر للأطفال المولودين بعملية قيصرية. إن حقيقة أن الميكروبيوم يُكتسب من جديد مع كل جيل تختلف اختلافًا واضحًا عن الجينوم البشري الذي يُورث.ثانيًا: تتميز كل منطقة من جسم البالغين بتركيبة فريدة من المجتمع الميكروبي. تُظهر البيانات تجمع بعض الأنواع الميكروبية في مواقع محددة من الجسم مثل الجلد، الأمعاء، تجويف الفم، الجهاز التنفسي أو الجهاز البولي التناسلي، بغض النظر عن الجنس أو العمر أو الوزن أو أي خصائص أخرى للمضيف. إن تكوين المجتمع الميكروبي تحدده موقع الجسم. من المرجح أن يكون الميكروبيوم البشري مشابهًا للعديد من النظم البيئية الميكروبية الأخرى على هذا الكوكب.ومع ذلك، فإن المسارات الأيضية الميكروبية الأساسية متشابهة تقريبًا في مختلف مواقع الجسم. وبالتالي، على الرغم من أن لكل موقع في الجسم مجمعًا ميكروبيًا خاصًا به، إلا أن جميع هذه المجمعات – بغض النظر عن تكوينها – يبدو أنها تعمل بطريقة متشابهة فيما يتعلق بالأيض.وأخيرًا، من الخصائص العالمية للميكروبيوم البشري أن ميكروبيوم الأمعاء يتغير طوال الحياة، حيث يختلف ميكروبيوم كبار السن (65 عامًا فأكثر) بشكل كبير عن ميكروبيوم البالغين في منتصف العمر. كجزء من مشروع ELDERMET7، أبلغ كلايسون وزملاؤه (2011) عن نسبة أعلى من Bacteroidetes، وتنوع تصنيفي ميكروبي أكبر بشكل عام، وتفاوت أكبر بين الأفراد في التركيب التصنيفي الميكروبي لدى كبار السن مقارنة بالبالغين في منتصف العمر.أما عند الرضع، فإن الاستمرارية الميكروبية خلال أول سنتين من الحياة تبدأ بالتغير مع الانتقال إلى نظام غذائي أكثر تنوعًا (ياتسونينكو وآخرون، 2012)، على عكس الاستقرار النسبي الذي يُلاحظ عند الأطفال الذين يرضعون من الثدي. وبحلول السنة الثانية من العمر، يستقر التركيب التصنيفي لميكروبيوم الأمعاء ويتطور إلى ما يبدو أنه الميكروبيوم البالغ (بالمر وآخرون، 2007).في الواقع، كلما كانت التصنيفات التصنيفية أكثر دقة، كان التنوع الميكروبي بين الأفراد أكبر. ولكل واحد منا “ميكروبات شخصية” تمنحنا خصائص معينة، ولكن لا يزال من غير الواضح ما هي هذه الخصائص.  ContactsHead office of the company BIODONATUM TRAIDING Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Dubai Silicon Oasis, DDP, Building A1 +971543499119 info@biodonatum.com Write to us",

        "text": "Home Blog العلاقة بين البيئة والميكروبيوم العلاقة بين البيئة والميكروبيوم هناك علاقة قوية بين الميكروبيوم البشري وبيئتنا الخارجية. يمكن تحديد ثلاثة مظاهر تعكس هذه العلاقة الوثيقة عبر مقاييس زمنية مختلفة جدًا:تأثير المضادات الحيوية على الميكروبيوم.معدلات عالية من النقل الأفقي للجينات بين البكتيريا في الميكروبيوم والبكتيريا في البيئة.التغيرات في الميكروبيوم عبر الزمن التطوري.إن التعرض للمضادات الحيوية له عواقب هائلة على الميكروبيوم. أولاً، يزداد عدد الميكروبات المقاومة للمضادات الحيوية. ثانيًا، يزداد عدد البكتيريا الحساسة، أي البكتيريا التي كان يمكن قتلها بالمضاد الحيوي ولكن لم تُقتل لأنها اكتسبت جينات مقاومة من جيرانها عبر النقل الأفقي للجينات. ثالثًا، يزداد عدد البكتيريا التي لم تتعرض أبدًا للمضاد الحيوي لأنها كانت محمية داخل المخاط أو بطريقة أخرى من التعرض. والنتيجة هي زيادة عامة في عدد البكتيريا المقاومة والمحمية. “في كثير من الحالات، عندما نتناول المضادات الحيوية، قد نتسبب غالبًا في مشاكل أكثر مما نعالج”، “وخاصة عندما لا نكمل كامل مدة العلاج”.النقل الأفقي للجينات (تبادل الجينات بين الميكروبات في غياب التكاثر الجنسي) بين البكتيريا في الميكروبيوم والبكتيريا في البيئة له أيضًا عواقب كبيرة على الميكروبيوم. قام Smillie وآخرون (2011) بحساب معدل النقل الأفقي للجينات بين أكثر من 2000 جينوم بكتيري، ووجدوا معدلًا أعلى من النقل الأفقي للجينات في الميكروبيوم البشري مقارنة بغيره من البيئات، حيث يحدث معظم النقل بين الميكروبات التي تسكن نفس مواقع الجسم (على سبيل المثال: ميكروبات من مجتمعين ميكروبيين معويين أكثر احتمالًا أن يشاركوا في النقل الأفقي للجينات مقارنةً بميكروب معوي وميكروب جلدي).واستنتج الباحثون أن النقل الأفقي للجينات لا يُحفَّز بالتقارب الجسدي، بل بالبيئة الإيكولوجية. والأهم أنهم أبلغوا أن أعلى معدلات النقل الأفقي للجينات بين الميكروبات المرتبطة بالإنسان وغير المرتبطة بالإنسان لوحظت في الميكروبات من الحيوانات الزراعية.وأخيرًا، فإن فهم السياق التطوري للميكروبيوم يسلط الضوء على “العلاقة النهائية” بين الميكروبيوم البشري وبيئتنا الخارجية. وليس من المبالغة القول إن الأمر لم يقتصر على تبادل الجينات فقط، بل تبادل الميكروبيوم أيضًا. فمن خلال اكتساب بعض مكوناته الميكروبية من أسلاف بشريين مبكرين آخرين، ربما كان الإنسان العاقل (H. sapiens) أكثر استعدادًا للتعامل مع أمراض معدية جديدة وضغوطات أخرى أثناء هجرته من إفريقيا إلى بيئات جديدة.وقد اقترح بعض العلماء أن الممارسات الاجتماعية الحديثة (مثل: الصرف الصحي، المياه النظيفة، الاستحمام، استخدام المضادات الحيوية، الولادة القيصرية، الرضاعة الصناعية، حشوات الأسنان الزئبقية) خلقت بيئة لم يعد فيها الميكروبيوم البشري يتعرض للتنوع الغني للميكروبات الذي واجهناه في ماضينا التطوري.كما اقترح Blaser وFalkow (2009) أنه إذا كان التلقيح الأولي يأتي من الأم، ولكن كل جيل لاحق من الأمهات أصبح أكثر افتقارًا للميكروبات من الجيل السابق، فإن كل جيل لاحق يكتسب عددًا أقل وأقل من الميكروبات المفيدة.

        "text": "Home Blog مخاطر الأمراضمخاطر الأمراض إن التفاعلات المعقدة بين الميكروبيوم ومضيفه لا تخلق فقط اختلافات في مخاطر الأمراض، بل تخلق أيضًا أنماطًا أيضية مختلفة (Holmes وآخرون، 2008a). في الواقع، فإن مخاطر الأمراض والأنماط الأيضية مترابطة بيولوجيًا وإحصائيًا، لذلك يمكن تقييم خطر المرض عن طريق قياس مستويات المستقلبات. ويقع تحليل المستقلبات ضمن نطاق علم الميتابونومكس (Metabonomics)، أي “القياس الكمي للاستجابات الأيضية متعددة المعايير (المعتمدة على الزمن) للأنظمة المعقدة عند التعرض لمحفز مرضي أو تعديل وراثي” (Nicholson وآخرون، 1999).إن تعقيد المعلومات المستخلصة من الملفات الأيضية الممتدة ينبع من حقيقة أن جميع الخلايا البشرية (أكثر من 500 نوع خلوي مختلف وظيفيًا) تنتج مستقلبات، وكذلك تفعل جميع الخلايا الميكروبية (Nicholson وآخرون، 2005). تنتج الميكروبات الأحماض الدهنية قصيرة السلسلة، والأحماض الصفراوية ومشتقات الأوكسيستيرول، والأمينات العطرية الفعالة وعائيًا، والكريزولات والأحماض العطرية، والكانابينويدات الداخلية، وجزيئات أخرى.يشارك العديد من المستقلبات الميكروبية في أيض الإنسان. على سبيل المثال، تُعد الأحماض الصفراوية جزيئات إشارة حاسمة للمضيف، وتُستقلب بشكل مشترك بواسطة الميكروبات، مما يكون له تأثير كبير على خطر الإصابة بأمراض الكبد والقولون (Nicholson وWilson، 2003). تُصنَّع الأحماض الصفراوية في الكبد يوميًا ثم تُفرَز إلى أمعاء الثدييات، حيث تقوم عصيات اللبن (Lactobacillus) وميكروبات معوية أخرى بنزع ارتباطها. ويمكن لميكروبات أخرى أن تُزيل الهيدروكسيل من حمض الكوليك لتحويله إلى حمض الديوكسي كوليك، وهو سام للكبد ومسرطن. كما أن الاستقلاب المشترك الميكروبي للأحماض الصفراوية يؤثر أيضًا على التوافر الحيوي للدهون.عند التفكير في كيفية تأثير الميكروبيوم المعوي على أيض الإنسان، فمن الشائع التفكير في معالجة القولون البعيد وإنتاج الأحماض الدهنية قصيرة السلسلة، ولكن الميكروبيوم يلعب أيضًا دورًا مهمًا في الأمعاء العليا، مثل التأثير على التوافر الحيوي للدهون.ومن الأدلة الأخرى على أن الميكروبيوم يلعب دورًا رئيسيًا في أيض الإنسان تأتي من دراسات جراحة السمنة على الحيوانات والبشر. تُعتبر جراحة المجازة المعدية على شكل Y (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB) المعيار الذهبي لجراحة السمنة، وهي مرتبطة بانخفاض بنسبة 80% في معدل الإصابة بمرض السكري خلال 24 ساعة من العملية. كما أن هذا الإجراء يرتبط بانخفاض خطر الإصابة بسرطان القولون وأنواع أخرى من السرطان. وبما أن مرض السكري يُشفى مباشرة (أي قبل فقدان الوزن اللاحق)، فلا بد من وجود تفسير بيوكيميائي لذلك. ويُرجَّح أن جزءًا من التفسير يكمن في الميكروبيوم.أفاد Zhang وآخرون (2009) بزيادة كبيرة في بكتيريا Gammaproteobacteria لدى مرضى RYGB مقارنة بالأشخاص العاديين والبدناء. وباستخدام نموذج الجرذان، أفاد Li وآخرون (2011b) أيضًا بزيادة في وفرة بكتيريا Gammaproteobacteria، بالإضافة إلى تغييرات كبيرة في أيض الأحماض الصفراوية بعد RYGB.وعلى الرغم من أن التغيرات في الميكروبيوم قد لا تكون “المفتاح” لفهم العلاقة بين جراحة السمنة وتغير مخاطر الإصابة بالسكري أو السرطان أو أمراض أخرى، إلا أنها “بالتأكيد جزء من الترس المحرك” (Holmes وآخرون، 2011).

Cada sitio del cuerpo representa un hábitat distinto que puede incluir miles de millones de células microbianas y cientos de cepas que varían casi por completo de un sitio a otro en todo el cuerpo.“Entonces casi siempre veía con gran sorpresa que en este objeto había muchos animales vivos muy pequeños que se movían muy bellamente”. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)Si bien no hay duda de que los gérmenes causan algunos de los mayores problemas del mundo (malaria, cólera, enfermedades transmitidas por alimentos y otras enfermedades infecciosas), la realidad es que el 99% de los gérmenes no causan enfermedades. Hay muchos microbios beneficiosos que contribuyen a la producción de alimentos (p. ej., pan, queso, yogur, chocolate, café, cerveza); producción y regeneración de suelos; descomposición de contaminantes y toxinas; producción de oxígeno; y la salud de las plantas, los animales y los seres humanos. “Todo ser vivo en este planeta tiene un microbioma… microbios asociados que respaldan la salud y el bienestar. » El microbioma es el conjunto completo de microbios (bacterias, virus, incluidos bacteriófagos, hongos, protozoos), así como sus genes y genomas dentro o sobre el cuerpo humano. Que microbios beneficiosos vivan dentro y sobre el cuerpo humano no es un concepto nuevo. Pero nos tomó cuatro siglos examinar estas comunidades microbianas lo más profundamente posible y verlas como algo más que patógenos. En particular, la microbiología ambiental y la ecología y evolución microbiana “proporcionan un marco conceptual para… reconocer que la gran mayoría de los microbios que viven dentro y sobre nosotros no son microbios ni patógenos, sino que pertenecen a ellos y ayudan a mantener nuestra salud y bienestar”.

        "text": "Home Blog El proyecto del microbioma humanoEl proyecto del microbioma humanoActualmente existe un proyecto internacional sobre el microbioma humano cuyo objetivo es caracterizar la composición genómica de todos los microbios que habitan el cuerpo humano. Hoy en día, nuestro microbioma ha identificado propiedades universales asociadas con la naturaleza dinámica del microbioma a lo largo del tiempo o cómo el microbioma cambia su composición a lo largo de la vida de una persona. Por ejemplo, una propiedad universal clave es que, a diferencia del genoma humano, el microbioma humano se adquiere de nuevo con cada generación, y los niños nacidos por vía vaginal adquieren microbiomas diferentes a los de los niños nacidos por cesárea (Domínguez-Bello et al., 2010).Los grandes conjuntos de datos recopilados muestran diferentes niveles de diversidad microbiana, según el nivel taxonómico, en diferentes partes del cuerpo (por ejemplo, las muestras vaginales muestran menos diversidad microbiana a nivel de género que otras partes del cuerpo, pero mayor diversidad a nivel de especie).Científicos de todo el mundo están trabajando en un enfoque integrador a nivel de sistemas para comprender la salud y las enfermedades humanas, así como el estudio del microbioma, que es el núcleo de este enfoque (Mirnezami et al., 2012; Nicholson, 2006). Sólo entendiendo cómo los microbios intestinales envían señales y funcionan, particularmente con respecto a sus efectos en el huésped humano, algún día los científicos podrán dilucidar suficiente biocomplejidad humana para hacer realidad el concepto de atención médica personalizada.Desde 2017, el microbioma humano es reconocido como un órgano por derecho propio.

        "text": "Home Blog Propiedades del microbiomaPropiedades del microbiomaLos científicos han identificado las propiedades “universales” del microbioma. En primer lugar, la microbiota humana se vuelve a adquirir con cada generación, al nacer. Los recién nacidos son como “imanes de gérmenes”. Los bebés nacidos por vía vaginal adquieren un microbioma diferente al de los bebés nacidos por cesárea, siendo el inóculo principal para los bebés nacidos por vía vaginal el microbioma vaginal de la madre y para los bebés nacidos por cesárea, la piel de la madre o la piel circundante. El hecho de que el microbioma se adquiera de nuevo con cada generación contrasta marcadamente con el genoma humano, que se hereda.La segunda propiedad universal es que cada parte del cuerpo adulto tiene una composición de comunidad microbiana distinta. Los datos muestran la agrupación de ciertos taxones microbianos en sitios específicos del cuerpo, como la piel, el intestino, la cavidad bucal, el tracto respiratorio o el tracto urogenital, independientemente del sexo, la edad, el peso o cualquier otra característica del huésped. La composición de la comunidad microbiana está determinada por la ubicación del cuerpo. “Es probable que el microbioma humano sea similar a muchos otros ecosistemas microbianos del planeta. »Sin embargo, las vías metabólicas microbianas subyacentes son prácticamente las mismas en diferentes partes del cuerpo. Entonces, aunque cada parte del cuerpo tiene su propio complejo microbiano, todos estos complejos, independientemente de su composición, parecen funcionar de la misma manera en lo que respecta al metabolismo.Una última propiedad universal del microbioma humano es que el microbioma intestinal cambia a lo largo de la vida, siendo el microbioma de los adultos mayores (65 años o más) muy diferente del de los adultos de mediana edad. Como parte del proyecto ELDERMET7, Claesson et al. (2011) informaron una mayor proporción de Bacteroidetes, una mayor diversidad taxonómica microbiana general y una mayor variabilidad interindividual en la composición taxonómica microbiana en adultos mayores en comparación con adultos de mediana edad. En los lactantes, la continuidad microbiana durante los primeros 1-2 años de vida comienza a cambiar con la transición a una dieta más variada (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), en contraste con la relativa estabilidad observada en los niños amamantados. Finalmente, a partir del segundo año de vida, la composición taxonómica del microbioma intestinal se estabiliza y el intestino desarrolla lo que parece ser el microbioma adulto (Palmer et al., 2007).De hecho, cuanto más fina es la clasificación taxonómica, más varía la composición microbiana según el individuo.Cada uno de nosotros tiene sus propios “microbios personales” que “nos dan a cada uno ciertas propiedades”, pero aún no está claro cuáles son estas propiedades.

        "text": "Home Blog El medio ambiente-microbiomaEl medio ambiente-microbiomaExiste una estrecha conexión entre el microbioma humano y nuestro entorno externo. Se pueden identificar tres fenómenos que reflejan esta estrecha relación en escalas de tiempo muy diferentes: (1) los efectos de los antibióticos en el microbioma, (2) altas tasas de transferencia horizontal de genes entre bacterias del microbioma y bacterias del medio ambiente, y (3) cambios en el microbioma a lo largo del tiempo evolutivo.La exposición a antibióticos tiene enormes consecuencias en el microbioma. En primer lugar, el número de microbios resistentes a los antibióticos está aumentando. En segundo lugar, hay un aumento en el número de bacterias susceptibles, es decir, bacterias que podrían haber sido eliminadas por el antibiótico pero no lo fueron porque adquirieron genes resistentes a través de la transferencia horizontal de genes con sus vecinos. En tercer lugar, hay un aumento en el número de bacterias que nunca estuvieron expuestas al antibiótico porque estaban incrustadas en la mucosidad o protegidas de otra manera de la exposición. Esto da como resultado un aumento general en el número de bacterias resistentes y protegidas. “En muchos casos, cuando tomamos antibióticos, muchas veces podemos causar más problemas de los que curamos”, “especialmente cuando no seguimos el tratamiento hasta el final”.La transferencia horizontal de genes (el intercambio de genes entre microbios en ausencia de reproducción sexual) entre bacterias del microbioma y bacterias del medio ambiente también tiene enormes consecuencias para el microbioma. Smillie et al. (2011) calcularon la tasa de transferencia horizontal de genes entre más de 2000 genomas bacterianos e informaron una mayor frecuencia de transferencia horizontal de genes en el microbioma humano que en otros entornos, y la mayoría de las transferencias ocurren entre microbios que habitan en los mismos sitios del cuerpo (p. ej., microbios de ambos Las comunidades microbianas intestinales tienen más probabilidades de participar en la transferencia horizontal de genes que un microbio intestinal y un microbio de la piel). Los investigadores concluyeron que la transferencia horizontal de genes no está impulsada por la proximidad física, sino más bien por la ecología. Es importante destacar que también informaron que las tasas más altas de transferencia horizontal de genes entre microbios asociados a humanos y no humanos se observaron en microbios originarios de animales de granja.Finalmente, comprender el contexto evolutivo del microbioma resalta el “vínculo último” entre el microbioma humano y nuestro entorno externo. “De hecho, no es exagerado sugerir que no sólo se compartieron los genes, sino que también se compartió el microbioma”. Al adquirir parte de su microbioma de otros homínidos primitivos, el H. sapiens pudo haber estado mejor equipado para hacer frente a nuevas enfermedades infecciosas y otros factores estresantes a medida que migraba de África a nuevos hábitats. Algunos científicos han sugerido que las prácticas sociales modernas (por ejemplo, saneamiento, agua limpia, baño, uso de antibióticos, cesáreas, fórmula infantil, empastes de amalgama de mercurio) crean un entorno en el que los microbiomas humanos ya no están expuestos a la rica diversidad de microbios que compartimos.  Encontrados en nuestro pasado evolutivo. Blaser y Falkow (2009) sugirieron que si el inóculo inicial proviene de la madre, pero cada generación sucesiva de madres es más pobre en microbios que la anterior, entonces cada generación sucesiva adquiere cada vez menos microbios beneficiosos.

        "text": "Home Blog Medicina personalizadaMedicina personalizadaLas soluciones de atención médica personalizadas requieren un enfoque de sistemas integradores para comprender la biocomplejidad humana. La investigación del microbioma es un elemento clave de este enfoque (Nicholson, 2006) (Cuadro 2-1). Los genes son sólo una parte de la interacción de los genes, la dieta y los microbios que hacen de los humanos el “supersistema” que son. Así, aunque los estudios de asociación de todo el genoma (GWAS), por ejemplo, son muy populares, no siempre son, en palabras de Jeremy Nicholson, “extremadamente reveladores”, porque la significación estadística a menudo tiene muy poco que ver con la importancia biológica.Esto no quiere decir que los estudios de la complejidad del genoma humano a nivel sistémico no proporcionen conocimientos interesantes. Ellos son. Por ejemplo, Loscalzo et al. (2007) utilizaron un enfoque sistémico para demostrar que casi todas las enfermedades humanas están genéticamente relacionadas, y que el mismo gen está implicado en diferentes trastornos. Sin embargo, comprender el genoma humano en sí mismo no es suficiente para hacer realidad el concepto de atención médica personalizada o de “precisión” (Mirnezami et al., 2012). El microbioma representa otro nivel de conexión genética. El desafío para el futuro es “pensar en capas de redes encima de redes”. En otras palabras, ¿cómo interactúan las redes del genoma humano con las redes del genoma del microbioma tanto en el tiempo como en el espacio? “Es realmente un problema bastante difícil”, “probablemente el problema biológico más difícil del siglo XXI”.Uno de los objetivos de una comprensión sistemática de la biocomplejidad humana es la implementación del concepto de atención médica personalizada o de “precisión” (Mirnezami et al., 2012). La metabonómica farmacéutica es un componente de esta preocupación. Farmacetabonómica como “predicción del resultado cuantitativo o efecto de una intervención biomédica basada en un modelo metabólico previo al tratamiento”. El enfoque se basa en el concepto de “hiperespacio metabólico”, donde la posición de una persona depende de muchos factores (genes, dieta, microbioma) (Nicholson y Wilson, 2003). Cuanto más cerca estén dos personas en el hiperespacio metabólico, más similares serán fisiológicamente y más probable será que se comporten de manera similar cuando se enfrenten a un problema (como un medicamento u otra intervención terapéutica). Como ejemplo de posibles aplicaciones farmacobonómicas, Clayton et al. (2006) demostraron que la toxicidad de los fármacos se podía predecir basándose en los perfiles metabólicos urinarios previos a la intervención.Además de la toxicidad de los fármacos, el perfil metabólico previo a la intervención también se ha utilizado para predecir el metabolismo de los fármacos. Por ejemplo, Clayton y colegas (2009) demostraron un vínculo entre los metabolitos microbianos intestinales y el metabolismo del paracetamol (Tylenol), y los patrones de excreción microbiana determinan en parte si un individuo tiene niveles altos o bajos de sulfato. La sulfatación es una de las dos vías principales del metabolismo del paracetamol, siendo los sulfatos débiles metabolizadores lentos. Nicholson explicó que los clostridios y otros microbios producen 4-cresol, un análogo estructural del paracetamol, que satura el sistema de sulfatación para formar un sulfato débil. Además, el 4-cresol compite por la sulfatación no sólo con el paracetamol, sino también con todos los fármacos hidroxilados. Nicholson dijo: “Afecta a cientos de compuestos diferentes. En realidad, una enzima microbiana intestinal tiene un efecto sorprendente sobre los patrones metabólicos y es potencialmente tóxica para una gran cantidad de fármacos. »Curiosamente, los niños autistas no pueden sulfatar el paracetamol (Alberti et al., 1999). De hecho, la capacidad de sulfatar el acetaminofén es una de las pruebas estadísticamente más significativas para el autismo. Nuevamente, hay evidencia de un vínculo microbiano. Finegood et al (2002) demostraron clostridios anormales en niños autistas. Altieri y colegas (2011) demostraron que los niños con autismo tienen niveles mucho más altos de cresol microbiano que los niños normales.

        "text": "Home Blog Riesgos de enfermedadRiesgos de enfermedadLas complejas interacciones entre el microbioma y su huésped crean algo más que un riesgo diferencial de enfermedad. También crean fenotipos metabólicos diferenciales (Holmes et al., 2008a). De hecho, los riesgos de enfermedad y los fenotipos metabólicos están relacionados tanto biológica como estadísticamente, de modo que el riesgo de enfermedad puede evaluarse midiendo los niveles de metabolitos. El análisis de metabolitos se incluye en la “metabonómica”, es decir, “la medición cuantitativa de respuestas metabólicas multiparamétricas (dependientes del tiempo) de sistemas complejos a un estímulo fisiopatológico o modificación genética” (Nicholson et al. ). otros, 1999).La complejidad de la información obtenida a partir de perfiles metabólicos extensos surge del hecho de que no sólo todas las células humanas producen metabolitos (con más de 500 tipos de células funcionalmente distintas), sino que también lo hacen todas las células microbianas (Nicholson et al., 2005). . Los microbios producen ácidos grasos de cadena corta, ácidos biliares y oxiesteroles relacionados, aminas vasoactivas (aromáticas), cresoles y ácidos aromáticos, endocannabinoides y otras moléculas.Muchos metabolitos microbianos están involucrados en el metabolismo humano. Por ejemplo, los ácidos biliares, que son moléculas de señalización esenciales para el huésped, son cometabolizados por microbios, lo que afecta significativamente el riesgo de enfermedades del hígado y el colon (Nicholson y Wilson, 2003). Los ácidos biliares se sintetizan diariamente en el hígado y luego se secretan en el intestino de los mamíferos, donde los Lactobacillus y otra microbiota intestinal los desconjugan en ácidos biliares. El ácido cólico, a su vez, puede ser deshidroxilado por otros microbios a ácido desoxicólico. El ácido desoxicólico es hepatotóxico y cancerígeno. El cometabolismo microbiano de los ácidos biliares también influye en la biodisponibilidad de los lípidos.Cuando se piensa en cómo el microbioma intestinal influye en el metabolismo humano, es común pensar en el procesamiento del colon distal y la producción de ácidos grasos de cadena corta, pero el microbioma también juega un papel importante en la parte superior del intestino, por ejemplo a través de los lípidos. . biodisponibilidad.Otro conjunto de evidencia que demuestra que el microbioma desempeña un papel clave en el metabolismo humano proviene de estudios de cirugía bariátrica en animales y humanos. El bypass gástrico en Y de Roux (RYGB), el estándar de oro de la cirugía bariátrica, se asocia con una reducción del 80 por ciento en la incidencia de diabetes dentro de las 24 horas posteriores a la cirugía. Este procedimiento también se asocia con un riesgo reducido de cáncer de colon y otros cánceres. Dado que la diabetes se cura inmediatamente (es decir, no después de una pérdida de peso posterior), debe haber una explicación bioquímica para esto. Parte de la explicación probablemente resida en el microbioma. Zhang et al (2009) informaron un aumento significativo en la cantidad de gammaproteobacterias en pacientes con RYGB en comparación con individuos normales y obesos. Utilizando un modelo de rata, Li et al. (2011b) también informaron un aumento en la abundancia de gammaproteobacterias, así como cambios masivos en el metabolismo de los ácidos biliares después del RYGB. Aunque los cambios en el microbioma pueden no ser la “clave” para comprender el vínculo entre la cirugía bariátrica y los cambios en el riesgo de diabetes, cáncer u otras enfermedades, “ciertamente son parte de la caja de velocidades” (Holmes et al., 2011).

Los estudios microbióticos han demostrado cambios metabólicos significativos en el microbioma, aunque las poblaciones microbianas reales cambiaron sólo “ligeramente”. Lo mismo se aplica al yogur, afirmó. Cuando la gente come yogur, los miles de millones de microbios que contiene no cambian la composición de los miles de millones de microbios de su microbioma. Sin embargo, provocan enormes cambios metabólicos.Datos recientes sugieren que sólo aproximadamente la mitad del microbioma intestinal está realmente activo en un momento dado. Por tanto, puede resultar útil saber qué parte del microbioma está activa. No sólo algunos microbios son activos y otros no, sino que algunos son más activos que otros. “Como ocurre con cualquier ecología, hay especies muy comunes que no hacen mucho y especies raras que realmente constituyen la columna vertebral de la ecología”.El microbio intestinal es capaz de producir riboflavina (vitamina B2), lo que plantea dudas sobre cuánta riboflavina proporciona nuestro microbioma frente a la cantidad que obtenemos a través de la dieta, y qué sustratos o nutrientes estimulan esta producción. Cabe señalar que los microbios intestinales no sólo producen vitaminas, sino que también compiten por el hierro, otros nutrientes y calorías, especialmente en los bebés.

Avicenna worked to create a cure for longevity, but never found it.The first scientific breakthrough was made by the Soviet scientist, Nobel laureate in the field of medicine Ilya Mechnikov in 1903. It was the works of Ilya Mechnikov that formed the basis of his world-famous Theory of Longevity. Mechnikov studied the human microbiome and bacteria in more than 18 countries. He saw that a record number of people over 100 years old lived in Bulgaria for that time, and the secret of their longevity was sour milk with lactobacilli, which they ate every day. Mechnikov conducted research and saw that the Bulgarian bacillus creates an acidic environment, which has a beneficial effect on the intestinal microflora and prevents the development of putrefactive bacteria. It is the diversity of microflora and the reduction in the number of putrefactive bacteria that affect the quality and duration of life. About Kakutaro MasagakiThe founderJapanese researcher Kakutaro Masagaki in 1905 was inspired by the works of Mechnikov and decided to conduct research in the field of lactobacilli fermentation. He began producing fresh yoghurts in Japan, which were fermented overnight, and in the morning they were delivered to Japanese homes for breakfast. Thanks to yoghurts, Kakutaro and yoghurt consumers were able to cope with intestinal problems, get rid of painful thinness and become healthier. In 1914, he opened a laboratory for the study of lactobacilli in Kyoto. In 1925 by mixing four types of lactic acid bacteria culture solution and sugar solution, we developed and released Ellie’, which is sweet and nutritious. This is the origin of modern lactic acid bacteria drinks. Kakutaro’s eldest son continues his father’s researchKaziyoshi MasagakiIn 1936, Kakutaro’s son decided to continue his research. He saw that the largest percentage of lactobacilli entering the body with food products die, and those that enter the intestines in most cases are not accepted by the microbiome. Kazuyoshi Masagaki thinks about how to improve the effect of lactobacilli on intestinal microflora. He developed a method for co-cultivating 8 strains of lactis acid bacteria. Established symbiotic culture method for 16 species of lactic acid bacteria. Kazuyoshi Masagaki studied under Kozui Otani, who was also researching microorganisms, in Dalian. Reverend Kozui Otani, a scientist and researcher, was actually the 22nd head priest of Nishi Honganji Temple and a person dedicated to Buddhism. Master Kozui Otani uniquely proposed a method of extracting active ingredients from fermented products of lactic acid bacteria’ based on the description in the Great General Nirvana Sutra. The master responded with an excerpt from a Buddhist text:“From cows – fresh milk, from fresh milk – cream, from cream – sour milk, then butter and from butter – ghee (Biodonatum). Biodonatum is the best, it contains everything natural for the human body.” The Breakthrough: Postbiotic InnovationInspired by Buddhist teachings and molecular science, Kazuyoshi developed Biodonatum®, a postbiotic created through a sophisticated 18–24 month fermentation of 31 probiotic strains on a plant-based medium. This method yields bioavailable compounds: peptides, SCFAs, enzymes, antioxidants, polyphenols, and regulatory molecules that signal your native gut flora to thrive. 1982 production of Postbiotic Biodonatum beganA method has been developed to extract the active ingredients from the fermentation of lactic acid bacteria.Not only “secrets of lactic acid bacteria” were isolated, but also “substances that protect the cells of lactic acid bacteria.”The Biodonatum® fermentation system, developed by Biogenics Tokyo, is rooted in epigenetic modulation and physiologic mimicry. Fermentation occurs in two stages—active growth and environmental modulation—followed by enzymatic hydrolysis that preserves biologically active metabolites. No chemicals, no high heat. Just precision, control, and natural intelligence.We use pesticide-free organic soy milk as our base—a hypoallergenic, highly absorbable substrate ideal for bacterial activity. Each strain is selected and cultured based on symbiosis, metabolite potential, and gene expression, using our proprietary biomimetic gut model for validation. The family business continues today Mr. S. Yoshinoby and Mrs. C. IshidaBiogenics Tokyo blends 2,500 years of Eastern wisdom with 20th-century microbiology and modern biotechnology. Founded in 1984, our goal is to restore health naturally—by empowering the body’s own microbial intelligence. BIODONATUM INFRASTRUTUREToday, Biodonatum® operates with full-cycle infrastructure:• A state-of-the-art research and development center in Japan• Our own organic soybean fields located in the protected ecological zone of Hokkaido• A GMP-certified manufacturing facility, ensuring safety, quality, and pharmaceutical-grade standardsThis vertical integration allows us to control every step of the process — from seed to science — and deliver uncompromised purity, efficacy, and sustainability in every product.This is more than a supplement—it’s a philosophy of health through fermentation, science, and trust in the body’s self-healing capacity.
