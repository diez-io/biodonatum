                    Our digestive system is an amazing and diverse world that contains 100 trillion bacteria. In 2017,
                    the human microbiome was recognized as a separate organ. Humans have 21,000 genes, and the bacteria
                    that make up our body have 4.4 million genes. Already today, scientists have been able to classify
                    about 5,000 microorganisms in our microbiome, which in 90% of cases cannot be cultivated in
                    laboratory conditions. Therefore, we are saying that a person, together with genetically compatible
                    microorganisms living in his intestines, represents a Superorganism with the organized work of
                    enzymes encoded by the human genome and the genomes of all symbiotic microorganisms. About 2.5-3
                    kg of bacteria live in our intestines; their weight is approximately equal to the weight of the
                    human brain. It has been scientifically proven that the gut and brain communicate through the vagus
                    nerve. The intestine is the first organ of the body’s immune system and contains more than 80% of

                    microorganisms in our microbiome, which in 90% of cases cannot be cultivated in laboratory
                    conditions. Therefore, we are saying that a person, together with genetically compatible
                    microorganisms living in his intestines, represents a Superorganism with the organized work of
                    enzymes encoded by the human genome and the genomes of all symbiotic microorganisms. About 2.5-3
                    kg of bacteria live in our intestines; their weight is approximately equal to the weight of the
                    human brain. It has been scientifically proven that the gut and brain communicate through the vagus
                    nerve. The intestine is the first organ of the body’s immune system and contains more than 80% of
                    all immunoglobulins, 10 (6) lymphocytes and 1 g of lymphoid tissue.
